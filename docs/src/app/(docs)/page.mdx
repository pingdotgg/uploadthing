# File Uploads For Developers

UploadThing is the easiest way to add file uploads to your full stack TypeScript
application. Many services have tried to build a "better S3", but in our
opinion, none found the right compromise of ownership, flexibility and safety.

<div className="not-prose mb-16 mt-6 flex gap-3">
  <Button href="https://uploadthing.com/dashboard" arrow="right">
    <>Get Started</>
  </Button>
  <Button href="/" variant="outline">
    <>Learn More</>
  </Button>
</div>

## Getting started {{ anchor: false }}

To get started, create a new application on the
[UploadThing Dashboard](https://uploadthing.com/dashboard/new) and grab an API
key from the API Keys tab. Then select your framework to learn how to integrate
UploadThing in your application in minutes. {{ className: 'lead' }}
