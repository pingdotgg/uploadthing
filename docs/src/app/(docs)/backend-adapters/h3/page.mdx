# Getting started with H3

> Added in `v5.7`

H3 is a HTTP framework that powers the web server framework Nitro and other
full-stack frameworks like Nuxt and soon also SolidStart. This adapter will work
for all frameworks that use H3 under the hood.

## Package Setup

### Install the package

```sh npm2yarn
npm install uploadthing
```

### Add env variables

<Note>
  If you don't already have a uploadthing secret key, [sign
  up](https://uploadthing.com/sign-in) and create one from the
  [dashboard!](https://uploadthing.com/dashboard)
</Note>

```bash
UPLOADTHING_TOKEN=... # A token for interacting with the SDK
```

## Set Up A FileRouter

### Creating your first FileRoute

All files uploaded to uploadthing are associated with a FileRoute. The following
is a very minimalistic example, with a single FileRoute "imageUploader". Think
of a FileRoute similar to an endpoint, it has:

- Permitted types ["image", "video", etc]
- Max file size
- (Optional) `middleware` to authenticate and tag requests
- `onUploadComplete` callback for when uploads are completed

To get full insight into what you can do with the FileRoutes, please refer to
the [File Router API](/file-routes).

```ts {{ title: "src/uploadthing.ts" }}
import { createUploadthing, type FileRouter } from "uploadthing/h3";

const f = createUploadthing();

export const uploadRouter = {
  imageUploader: f({
    image: {
      maxFileSize: "4MB",
      maxFileCount: 4,
    },
  }).onUploadComplete((data) => {
    console.log("upload completed", data);
  }),
} satisfies FileRouter;

export type OurFileRouter = typeof uploadRouter;
```

### Create the H3 event handlers

<CodeGroup>

```ts {{ title: 'Vanilla H3' }}
import { createApp, createRouter } from "h3";

import { createRouteHandler } from "uploadthing/h3";
import { uploadRouter } from "./router";

const app = createApp();
const router = createRouter();

router.use(
  "/api/uploadthing",
  createRouteHandler({
    router: uploadRouter,
    config: { ... },
  })
);

app.use(router);

export { app }; // Run server with e.g. `listhen`
```

```ts {{ title: 'Nitro' }}
import { createRouteHandler } from "uploadthing/h3";

import { uploadRouter } from "./router";

export default createRouteHandler({
  router: uploadRouter,
  config: { ... },
});
```

</CodeGroup>

> See configuration options in
> [server API reference](/api-reference/server#create-route-handler)

### Use the FileRouter in your app

Client side usage differs ever so slightly from the fullstack framework setups
when using a separate backend server. You'll need to set the URL of your server
when you generate the components and helpers.

```tsx
import { generateUploadButton } from "@uploadthing/react";

export const UploadButton = generateUploadButton({
  url: "https://your-server.com/api/uploadthing",
});
// ...
```

<Note>
  Please note that you might need to setup some CORS rules on your server to
  allow the client to make requests to the server.
</Note>

For the remaining usage, please refer to client side examples of the fullstack
framework guides:

- [Next.js](/getting-started/appdir#create-the-upload-thing-components)
- [Solid.js](/getting-started/solid#creating-the-upload-thing-components)
- [Vue](https://github.com/pingdotgg/uploadthing/tree/main/examples/backend-adapters/client-vue)
- [Svelte](/getting-started/svelte#creating-the-upload-thing-helpers)
