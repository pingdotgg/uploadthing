# Getting started with Fetch / Edge Runtimes

UploadThing is compatible with any runtime that follow the
[WinterCG](https://wintercg.org/).

## Common setup

### Package Setup

### Install the package

```sh npm2yarn
npm install uploadthing
```

#### Add env variables

<Note>
  If you don't already have a uploadthing secret key, [sign
  up](https://uploadthing.com/sign-in) and create one from the
  [dashboard!](https://uploadthing.com/dashboard)
</Note>

```bash
UPLOADTHING_TOKEN=... # A token for interacting with the SDK
```

### Set Up A FileRouter

All files uploaded to uploadthing are associated with a FileRoute. The following
is a very minimalistic example, with a single FileRoute "imageUploader". Think
of a FileRoute similar to an endpoint, it has:

- Permitted types ["image", "video", etc]
- Max file size
- (Optional) `middleware` to authenticate and tag requests
- `onUploadComplete` callback for when uploads are completed

To get full insight into what you can do with the FileRoutes, please refer to
the [File Router API](/file-routes).

```ts
import { createUploadthing, type FileRouter } from "uploadthing/server";

const f = createUploadthing();

export const uploadRouter = {
  imageUploader: f({
    image: {
      maxFileSize: "4MB",
      maxFileCount: 4,
    },
  }).onUploadComplete((data) => {
    console.log("upload completed", data);
  }),
} satisfies FileRouter;

export type OurFileRouter = typeof uploadRouter;
```

## Runtimes-specific setup

> See configuration options in
> [server API reference](/api-reference/server#create-route-handler)

### Astro

```ts
import { createRouteHandler } from "uploadthing/server";

import { uploadRouter } from "../../server/uploadthing";

const handlers = createRouteHandler({
  router: uploadRouter,
  config: { ... },
});
export { handlers as GET, handlers as POST };
```

<Note>
  Read more in our [Getting Started with Astro](/getting-started/astro) guide.
</Note>

### Elysia

```ts
import { Elysia } from "elysia";

import { createRouteHandler } from "uploadthing/server";

import { uploadRouter } from "./uploadthing.ts";

const handler = createRouteHandler({
  router: uploadRouter,
  config: { ... },
});

new Elysia()
  .get("/api", () => "Hello from Elysia!")
  .get("/api/uploadthing", (ev) => handler(ev.request))
  .post("/api/uploadthing", (ev) => handler(ev.request))
  .listen(3000, (server) => {
    console.log(`Server listening on port ${server.port}`);
  });
```

### Hono

```ts
import { Hono } from "hono";

import { createRouteHandler } from "uploadthing/server";

import { uploadRouter } from "./uploadthing.ts";

const handlers = createRouteHandler({
  router: uploadRouter,
  config: { ... },
});

const app = new Hono();

app.all("/api/uploadthing", (context) => handlers(context.req.raw));

export default app;
```

### Cloudflare Workers

<Note>
  Due to Cloudflare's lack of global environment variables and lack of
  `init.cache` on `fetch`, we need to due some manual setup to make it
  compatible.
</Note>

```ts
import { createRouteHandler } from "uploadthing/server";

import { uploadRouter } from "./uploadthing.ts";

export default {
  async fetch(request: Request, env: Env, ctx: ExecutionContext) {
    const handlers = createRouteHandler({
      router: uploadRouter,
      config: {
        /**
         * Since workers doesn't have envs on `process`. We need to pass
         * secret and isDev flag manually.
         */
        token: env.UPLOADTHING_TOKEN,
        isDev: env.ENVIRONMENT === "development",
        /*
         * Cloudflare Workers doesn't support the cache option
         * so we need to remove it from the request init.
         */
        fetch: (url, init) => {
          if (init && "cache" in init) delete init.cache;
          return fetch(url, init);
        },
        /**
         * UploadThing dev server leaves some promises hanging around that we
         * need to wait for to prevent the worker from exiting prematurely.
         */
        handleDaemonPromise: (promise) => ctx.waitUntil(promise),
      },
    });

    // World's simplest router. Handle GET/POST requests to /api/uploadthing
    switch (new URL(request.url).pathname) {
      case "/api/uploadthing": {
        if (request.method !== "POST" && request.method !== "GET") {
          return new Response("Method not allowed", { status: 405 });
        }
        return await handlers[request.method](request);
      }
      default: {
        return new Response("Not found", { status: 404 });
      }
    }
  },
};
```

## Use the FileRouter in your app

Client side usage differs ever so slightly from the fullstack framework setups
when using a separate backend server. You'll need to set the URL of your server
when you generate the components and helpers.

```tsx
import { generateUploadButton } from "@uploadthing/react";

export const UploadButton = generateUploadButton({
  url: "https://your-server.com/api/uploadthing",
});
// ...
```

<Note>
  Please note that you might need to setup some CORS rules on your server to
  allow the client to make requests to the server.
</Note>

For the remaining usage, please refer to client side examples of the fullstack
framework guides:

- [Next.js](/getting-started/appdir#create-the-upload-thing-components)
- [Solid.js](/getting-started/solid#creating-the-upload-thing-components)
- [Vue](https://github.com/pingdotgg/uploadthing/tree/main/examples/backend-adapters/client-vue)
- [Svelte](/getting-started/svelte#creating-the-upload-thing-helpers)
