# uploadthing/client

The UploadThing Client module provides utilities for working files in your
application and communicating with your backend file router.

## `uploadFiles` {{ tag: 'function', since: '5.0' }}

This function is used to perform
[client side uploads](/uploading-files#client-side-uploads) by requesting
presigned URLs from your backend file router, and then uploading the files to
the storage provider.

Use the `genUploader` factory function to generate a typed function that matches
the signature of your file router, which will allow autocompletion and type
checking on endpoint, route input and callback data types.

```ts
import { genUploader } from "uploadthing/client";

import type { UploadRouter } from "~/server/uploadthing";

export const { uploadFiles } = genUploader<UploadRouter>();

const response = await uploadFiles("routeEndpoint", {
  files: [],
});
```

### Parameters

The first parameter is the route endpoint to upload to, and the second parameter
is an options object:

<Note>
  The endpoint arg may be a string literal or a callback function:

```ts
await uploadFiles((rr) => rr.routeEndpoint, { ... })
```

This way allows `Go to Defintion` on `routeEndpoint` to take you straight to
your backend file route definition, which is not possible when using a string
literal parameter.

</Note>

<Properties>
  <Property name="files" type="File[]" required since="5.0">
    An array of files to upload.
  </Property>
  <Property name="input" type="TInput" since="5.0"> 
    Input JSON data matching your validator set on the [FileRoute](/file-routes#input)
    to send with the request.
  </Property>
  <Property name="headers" type="HeadersInit | () => HeadersInit" since="5.1">
    Headers to be sent along the request to request the presigned URLs. Useful
    for authentication outside full-stack framework setups.
  </Property>
  <Property name="signal" type="AbortSignal" since="6.7">
    An abort signal to abort the upload.
  </Property>
  <Property name="onUploadBegin" type="({ file: string }) => void" since="5.4">
    Callback function called after the presigned URLs have been retrieved, just before 
    the file is uploaded. Called once per file.
  </Property>
  <Property
    name="onUploadProgress"
    type="({ file, progress }) => void"
    since="6.4"
  >
    Callback function that gets continuously called as the file is uploaded to the storage provider.
  </Property>

</Properties>

### Returns

The function returns a `Promise` that resolves to an array of objects:

<Properties>
  <Property name="name" type="string">
    The name of the file.
  </Property>
  <Property name="size" type="number">
    The size of the file in bytes.
  </Property>
  <Property name="type" type="string">
    The type of the file.
  </Property>
  <Property name="key" type="string | null">
    The file key of the file.
  </Property>
  <Property name="url" type="string">
    The url of the file.
  </Property>
  <Property name="customId" type="string | null">
    The custom id of the file, if provided on upload.
  </Property>
  <Property name="serverData" type="Generic">
    The data returned from the `onUploadComplete` callback on the file route.
    This will be `null` if `RouteOptions.awaitServerData` isn't enabled.
  </Property>
</Properties>

## `createUpload` {{ tag: 'function', since: '7.0' }}

Create a resumable upload. Resumable uploads allows you to start an upload,
pause it, and then resume it at a later time. As long as the presigned URL is
valid, you can continue the upload from where it left off.

As for `uploadFiles`, use the `genUploader` factory function to generate a typed
function that matches the signature of your file router, which will allow
autocompletion and type checking on endpoint, route input and callback data
types.

```ts
import { genUploader } from "uploadthing/client";

import type { UploadRouter } from "~/server/uploadthing";

export const { createUpload } = genUploader<UploadRouter>();

// Create the upload. The files will start uploading immediately.
const { pauseUpload, resumeUpload, done } = createUpload("routeEndpoint", {
  files: [],
});

// Pause the upload of a file
pauseUpload(file);

// Resume the upload of a file
resumeUpload(file);

// Await the completion of all files
const files = await done();
```

### Parameters

The first parameter is the route endpoint to upload to, and the second parameter
is an options object:

<Properties>

    An array of files to upload.
  </Property>
  <Property name="input" type="TInput" since="7.0">

    the storage provider.
  </Property>
</Properties>

### Returns

<Properties>
  <Property name="pauseUpload" type="(file?: File) => void" since="7.0">
    Pause the upload of a file. If no file is provided, all files will be
