# UploadThing React

React bindings for UploadThing.

## generateComponents {{ tag: 'factory', deprecated: true }}

<Warning>
  As of `v6.2.1`, the `generateComponents` function has been deprecated in favor
  of the `generateUploadButton` and `generateUploadDropzone` functions to
  improve tree-shaking.
</Warning>

The `generateComponents` function is used to generate the UploadButton and
UploadDropzone components you use to interact with UploadThing. Generating
components allows for fully typesafe components bound to the type of your file
router.

```tsx {{ title: "utils/uploadthing.tsx" }}
import { generateComponents } from "@uploadthing/react";

import type { OurFileRouter } from "~/app/api/uploadthing/core";

export const { UploadButton, UploadDropzone } =
  generateComponents<OurFileRouter>();
```

## generateUploadButton {{ tag: 'factory', since: '6.2' }}

The `generateUploadButton` function is used to generate the UploadButton
component you use to interact with UploadThing. Generating components allows for
fully typesafe components bound to the type of your file router.

```tsx {{ title: "utils/uploadthing.tsx" }}
import { generateUploadButton } from "@uploadthing/react";

export const UploadButton = generateUploadButton<OurFileRouter>();
```

### Parameters

<Properties>
  <Property
    name="url"
    type="string | URL"
    since="6.0"
    default="(VERCEL_URL ?? window.location.origin) + '/api/uploadthing'"
  >
    The url to where you are serving your uploadthing file router.
    <Warning>
      Required if your [route
      handler](/api-reference/server#create-route-handler) is not served from
      `/api/uploadthing`
    </Warning>
  </Property>
</Properties>

### Returns

[`UploadButton`](/api-reference/react#upload-button)

## generateUploadDropzone {{ tag: 'factory', since: '6.2' }}

The `generateUploadDropzone` function is used to generate the UploadDropzone
component you use to interact with UploadThing. Generating components allows for
fully typesafe components bound to the type of your file router.

```tsx {{ title: "utils/uploadthing.tsx" }}
import { generateUploadDropzone } from "@uploadthing/react";

export const UploadDropzone = generateUploadDropzone<OurFileRouter>();
```

### Parameters

<Properties>
  <Property
    name="url"

    since="6.0"
    default="(VERCEL_URL ?? window.location.origin) + '/api/uploadthing'"
  >
    The url to where you are serving your uploadthing file router.
    <Warning>
      Required if your [route
      handler](/api-reference/server#create-route-handler) is not served from
      `/api/uploadthing`
    </Warning>
  </Property>
</Properties>

### Returns

[`UploadDropzone`](/api-reference/react#upload-dropzone)

## generateReactHelpers {{ tag: 'factory', since: '5.0' }}

The `generateReactHelpers` function is used to generate the
[useUploadThing](/api-reference/react#use-upload-thing) hook and the
[uploadFiles]/api-reference/client#upload-files) functions you use to interact
with UploadThing in custom components. It takes your File Router as a generic

```tsx
import { generateReactHelpers } from "@uploadthing/react";

import type { OurFileRouter } from "~/app/api/uploadthing/core";

export const { useUploadThing, uploadFiles } =
  generateReactHelpers<OurFileRouter>();
```

### Parameters

    name="url"
    type="string | URL"
    since="6.0"
    default="(VERCEL_URL ?? window.location.origin) + '/api/uploadthing'"
  >
    The url to where you are serving your uploadthing file router.
    <Warning>
      Required if your [route
      handler](/api-reference/server#create-route-handler) is not served from

    <Note>Can only be used if the NextSSRPlugin is used in the app.</Note>
  </Property>
</Properties>

## UploadButton {{ tag: 'component', since: '5.0' }}

<Note>
  We strongly recommend using the
  [`generateUploadButton`](/api-reference/react#generate-upload-button) function
  instead of importing it from `@uploadthing/react` directly for a fully
  typesafe component.
</Note>

A simple button that opens the native file picker and uploads the selected
files. The default button is shown below. See [Theming](/concepts/theming) on
how to customize it.

import { UploadButton } from "@/components/UploadThing";

<UploadButton
  className="mt-5"
  __internal_button_disabled
  __internal_state="ready"
  content={{
    allowedContent: "Allowed content",
    button: "Choose file(s)",
  }}
/>

```tsx {{ title: "app/example-uploader.tsx" }}
import { UploadButton } from "@uploadthing/react";

import { OurFileRouter } from "./api/uploadthing/core";

export const OurUploadButton = () => (
  <UploadButton<OurFileRouter>
    endpoint="imageUploader"
    onClientUploadComplete={(res) => {
      // Do something with the response
      console.log("Files: ", res);
      alert("Upload Completed");
    }}
    onUploadError={(error: Error) => {
      // Do something with the error.
      alert(`ERROR! ${error.message}`);
    }}
    onBeforeUploadBegin={(files) => {
      // Preprocess files before uploading (e.g. rename them)
      return files.map(
        (f) => new File([f], "renamed-" + f.name, { type: f.type }),
      );
    }}
    onUploadBegin={(name) => {
      // Do something once upload begins
      console.log("Uploading: ", name);
    }}
  />
);
```

</Properties>

<Note>
  If you want to disable the button based on when your `input` is not satisfied,
  you can place your validator in a shared file, so that you can import it in
  both the server-side `.input()` and on the client-side for your `disabled`
  prop logic.
</Note>

## UploadDropzone {{ tag: 'component', since: '5.0' }}

<Note>

upload. The default dropzone is shown below. See [Theming](/concepts/theming) on
how to customize it.

<UploadDropzone
  __internal_state="ready"
  __internal_button_disabled
  __internal_dropzone_disabled
  __internal_show_button

## useDropzone {{ tag: 'hook', since: '5.6' }}

This hook is currently a minified fork of
[react-dropzone](https://github.com/react-dropzone/react-dropzone) with better
ESM support. See [their docs](https://react-dropzone.js.org/) for reference.

You can import the minified hook from `@uploadthing/react`. If you need access
to any of the removed APIs, you should import the original hook from
`react-dropzone`.

<Note>
  This hook isn't strictly covered by semver as we might make changes to tailor
  it to our needs in a future minor release. Migration guides will be provided
  if this happens.
</Note>

## useUploadThing {{ tag: 'hook', since: '5.0' }}

This hook provides a function to start uploading, an `isUploading` state, and
the `permittedFileInfo` which gives information about what file types, sizes and
counts are allowed by the endpoint.

<Note>
  You have to generate this hook using the
  [`generateReactHelpers`](/api-reference/react#generate-react-helpers)
  function.
</Note>

### Parameters

The first parameter is the route endpoint to upload to, and the second parameter
is an options object:

  <Property name="headers" type="HeadersInit | () => HeadersInit" since="6.4">

### Example

The following example shows a simple dropzone component using the `useDropzone`
and `useUploadThing` hooks. For a more complete example, take a look at
[our prebuilt components](https://github.com/pingdotgg/uploadthing/tree/main/packages/react/src/components).

```tsx {{ title: "app/example-custom-uploader.tsx" }}
import { useDropzone } from "@uploadthing/react";
import { generateClientDropzoneAccept } from "uploadthing/client";

import { useUploadThing } from "~/utils/uploadthing";

export function MultiUploader() {
  const [files, setFiles] = useState<File[]>([]);
  const onDrop = useCallback((acceptedFiles: File[]) => {
    setFiles(acceptedFiles);
  }, []);

  const { startUpload, routeConfig } = useUploadThing("myUploadEndpoint", {
    onClientUploadComplete: () => {
      alert("uploaded successfully!");
    },
    onUploadError: () => {
      alert("error occurred while uploading");
    },
    onUploadBegin: ({ file }) => {
      console.log("upload has begun for", file);
    },
  });

  const { getRootProps, getInputProps } = useDropzone({
    onDrop,
    accept: generateClientDropzoneAccept(
      generatePermittedFileTypes(routeConfig).fileTypes,
    ),
  });

  return (
    <div {...getRootProps()}>
      <input {...getInputProps()} />
      <div>
        {files.length > 0 && (
          <button onClick={() => startUpload(files)}>
            Upload {files.length} files
          </button>
        )}
      </div>
      Drop files here!
    </div>
  );
}
```
