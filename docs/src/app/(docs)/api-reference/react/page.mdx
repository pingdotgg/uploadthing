# UploadThing React

React bindings for UploadThing.

## generateComponents {{ tag: 'factory', deprecated: true }}

<Warning>
  As of `v6.2.1`, the `generateComponents` function has been deprecated in favor
  of the `generateUploadButton` and `generateUploadDropzone` functions to
  improve tree-shaking.
</Warning>

The `generateComponents` function is used to generate the UploadButton and
UploadDropzone components you use to interact with UploadThing. Generating
components allows for fully typesafe components bound to the type of your file
router.

```tsx {{ title: "utils/uploadthing.tsx" }}
import { generateComponents } from "@uploadthing/react";

import type { OurFileRouter } from "~/app/api/uploadthing/core";

export const { UploadButton, UploadDropzone } =
  generateComponents<OurFileRouter>();
```

## generateUploadButton {{ tag: 'factory', since: '6.2' }}

The `generateUploadButton` function is used to generate the UploadButton
component you use to interact with UploadThing. Generating components allows for
fully typesafe components bound to the type of your file router.

```tsx {{ title: "utils/uploadthing.tsx" }}
import { generateUploadButton } from "@uploadthing/react";

export const UploadButton = generateUploadButton<OurFileRouter>();
```

### Parameters

<Properties>
  <Property
    name="url"
    type="string | URL"
    since="6.0"
    default="(VERCEL_URL ?? window.location.origin) + '/api/uploadthing'"
  >
    The url to where you are serving your uploadthing file router.
    <Warning>
      Required if your [route
      handler](/api-reference/server#create-route-handler) is not served from
      `/api/uploadthing`
    </Warning>
  </Property>
</Properties>

### Returns

[`UploadButton`](/api-reference/react#upload-button)

## generateUploadDropzone {{ tag: 'factory', since: '6.2' }}

The `generateUploadDropzone` function is used to generate the UploadDropzone
component you use to interact with UploadThing. Generating components allows for
fully typesafe components bound to the type of your file router.

```tsx {{ title: "utils/uploadthing.tsx" }}
import { generateUploadDropzone } from "@uploadthing/react";

export const UploadDropzone = generateUploadDropzone<OurFileRouter>();
```

### Parameters

  >
    The url to where you are serving your uploadthing file router.
    <Warning>
      Required if your [route
      handler](/api-reference/server#create-route-handler) is not served from
      `/api/uploadthing`
    </Warning>
  </Property>
</Properties>

### Returns

[`UploadDropzone`](/api-reference/react#upload-dropzone)

## generateReactHelpers {{ tag: 'factory', since: '5.0' }}

[useUploadThing](/api-reference/react#use-upload-thing) hook and the
[uploadFiles](/api-reference/client#upload-files) functions you use to interact
with UploadThing in custom components. It takes your File Router as a generic

```tsx
import { generateReactHelpers } from "@uploadthing/react";

import type { OurFileRouter } from "~/app/api/uploadthing/core";

export const { useUploadThing, uploadFiles } =
  generateReactHelpers<OurFileRouter>();
```

    <Note>Can only be used if the NextSSRPlugin is used in the app.</Note>
  </Property>
</Properties>

## UploadButton {{ tag: 'component', since: '5.0' }}

<Note>
  We strongly recommend using the
  [`generateUploadButton`](/api-reference/react#generate-upload-button) function
  instead of importing it from `@uploadthing/react` directly for a fully
  typesafe component.
</Note>

A simple button that opens the native file picker and uploads the selected
files. The default button is shown below. See [Theming](/concepts/theming) on
how to customize it.

import { UploadButton } from "@/components/UploadThing";

<UploadButton
  className="mt-5"
  __internal_button_disabled
  __internal_state="ready"
  content={{
    allowedContent: "Allowed content",
    button: "Choose file(s)",
  }}
/>

```tsx {{ title: "app/example-uploader.tsx" }}
import { UploadButton } from "@uploadthing/react";

import { OurFileRouter } from "./api/uploadthing/core";

export const OurUploadButton = () => (
  <UploadButton<OurFileRouter>
    endpoint="imageUploader"
    onClientUploadComplete={(res) => {
      // Do something with the response
      console.log("Files: ", res);
      alert("Upload Completed");
    }}
    onUploadError={(error: Error) => {
      // Do something with the error.
      alert(`ERROR! ${error.message}`);
    }}
    onBeforeUploadBegin={(files) => {
      // Preprocess files before uploading (e.g. rename them)
      return files.map(
        (f) => new File([f], "renamed-" + f.name, { type: f.type }),
      );
    }}
    onUploadBegin={(name) => {
      // Do something once upload begins
      console.log("Uploading: ", name);
    }}
  />
);
```

### Props

<Properties>
  <Property name="endpoint" type="EndpointArg<FileRouter>" required>
    The name/slug of the [route](/file-routes) you want to upload to

    <Note>

      The endpoint arg may be a string literal or a callback function:

      ```ts
      await uploadFiles((rr) => rr.routeEndpoint, { ... })
      ```

      This way allows `Go to Defintion` on `routeEndpoint` to take you straight to
      your backend file route definition, which is not possible when using a string
      literal parameter.

    </Note>

  </Property>
<Property name="input" type="TInput" since="5.0"> 
    Input JSON data matching your validator set on the [FileRoute](/file-routes#input)
    to send with the request.
  </Property>
  <Property name="headers" type="HeadersInit | () => HeadersInit" since="6.4">
    Headers to be sent along the request to request the presigned URLs. Useful
    for authentication outside full-stack framework setups.
  </Property>
  <Property
    name="onClientUploadComplete"
    type="(UploadedFileResponse[]) => void"
    since="5.0"
  >
    Callback function that runs **after** the serverside
    [`onUploadComplete`](/file-routes#on-upload-complete) callback.
    ```ts
    export type UploadFileResponse<TServerOutput> = {
      name: string
      size: number
      key: string
      url: string
      customId: string | null
      // The data returned from the `onUploadComplete` callback on
      // the file route. Note that if `RouteOptions.awaitServerData`
      // isn't enabled this will be `null`.
      serverData: TServerOutput
    }
    ```

  </Property>
  <Property name="onUploadError" type="function" since="5.0">
    Callback function when that runs when an upload fails.
  </Property>
  <Property name="onUploadAborted" type="function" since="6.7">
    Callback function when that runs when an upload is aborted.
  </Property>
  <Property name="onUploadProgress" type="function" since="5.1">
    Callback function that gets continuously called as the file is uploaded to
    the storage provider.
  </Property>
  <Property
    name="onBeforeUploadBegin"
    type="(files: File[]) => File[]"
    since="6.0"
  >
    Callback function called before requesting the presigned URLs. The files
    returned are the files that will be uploaded, meaning you can use this to
    e.g. rename or resize the files.
  </Property>
  <Property name="onUploadBegin" type="({ file: string }) => void" since="5.4">
    Callback function called after the presigned URLs have been retrieved, just before 
    the file is uploaded. Called once per file.
  </Property>
  <Property name="disabled" type="boolean" since="6.7" defaultValue="false">
    Disables the button.
  </Property>
  <Property name="config.appendOnPaste" type="boolean" since="5.7" defaultValue="false">
    Enables ability to paste files from clipboard when the button is focused.
  </Property>
  <Property
    name="config.mode"
    type="auto | manual"
    since="5.4"
    defaultValue="auto"
  >
    Set the mode of the button. 'auto' triggers upload right after selection,
    'manual' requires an extra click to start uploading.
  </Property>
  <Property name="config.cn" type="(classes: string[]) => string" since="7.0" defaultValue="classes.join(' ')">
    Function that merges classes together. May be required if you are [are theming components with TailwindCSS](/concepts/theming#theming-with-tailwind-css)
    and your classes are not applied correctly.
  </Property>
</Properties>

<Note>
  If you want to disable the button based on when your `input` is not satisfied,
  you can place your validator in a shared file, so that you can import it in
  both the server-side `.input()` and on the client-side for your `disabled`
  prop logic.
</Note>

## UploadDropzone {{ tag: 'component', since: '5.0' }}

<Note>
  We strongly recommend using the
  [`generateUploadDropzone`](/api-reference/react#generate-upload-dropzone)
  function instead of importing it from `@uploadthing/react` directly for a
  fully typesafe component.
</Note>

A `react-dropzone` powered dropzone that let's you drag and drop files to
upload. The default dropzone is shown below. See [Theming](/concepts/theming) on
how to customize it.

import { UploadDropzone } from "@/components/UploadThing";

<UploadDropzone
  __internal_state="ready"
  __internal_button_disabled
  __internal_dropzone_disabled
  __internal_show_button
  content={{
    allowedContent: "Allowed content",
    button: "Ready",
  }}
/>

```tsx {{ title: "app/example-uploader.tsx" }}
import { UploadDropzone } from "@uploadthing/react";

import { OurFileRouter } from "./api/uploadthing/core";

export const OurUploadDropzone = () => (
  <UploadDropzone<OurFileRouter>
    endpoint="withoutMdwr"
    onClientUploadComplete={(res) => {
      // Do something with the response
      console.log("Files: ", res);
      alert("Upload Completed");
    }}
    onUploadError={(error: Error) => {
      alert(`ERROR! ${error.message}`);
    }}
    onUploadBegin={(name) => {
      // Do something once upload begins
      console.log("Uploading: ", name);
    }}
    onDrop={(acceptedFiles) => {
      // Do something with the accepted files
      console.log("Accepted files: ", acceptedFiles);
    }}
  />
);
```

### Props

</Note>

## useDropzone {{ tag: 'hook', since: '5.6' }}

This hook is currently a minified fork of
[react-dropzone](https://github.com/react-dropzone/react-dropzone) with better
ESM support. See [their docs](https://react-dropzone.js.org/) for reference.

You can import the minified hook from `@uploadthing/react`. If you need access
to any of the removed APIs, you should import the original hook from
`react-dropzone`.

<Note>
  This hook isn't strictly covered by semver as we might make changes to tailor
  it to our needs in a future minor release. Migration guides will be provided
  if this happens.
</Note>

## useUploadThing {{ tag: 'hook', since: '5.0' }}

This hook provides a function to start uploading, an `isUploading` state, and
the `permittedFileInfo` which gives information about what file types, sizes and
counts are allowed by the endpoint.

<Note>
  You have to generate this hook using the
  [`generateReactHelpers`](/api-reference/react#generate-react-helpers)
  function.
</Note>

### Parameters

The first parameter is the route endpoint to upload to, and the second parameter
is an options object:

<Note>
  The endpoint arg may be a string literal or a callback function:

```ts
useUploadThing((rr) => rr.routeEndpoint, { ... })
```

This way allows `Go to Defintion` on `routeEndpoint` to take you straight to
your backend file route definition, which is not possible when using a string
literal parameter.

</Note>

<Properties>

    An array of files to upload.
  </Property>
  <Property name="headers" type="HeadersInit | () => HeadersInit" since="6.4">

  </Property>
  <Property
    name="onClientUploadComplete"

### Example

The following example shows a simple dropzone component using the `useDropzone`
and `useUploadThing` hooks. For a more complete example, take a look at
[our prebuilt components](https://github.com/pingdotgg/uploadthing/tree/main/packages/react/src/components).

```tsx {{ title: "app/example-custom-uploader.tsx" }}
import { useDropzone } from "@uploadthing/react";
import { generateClientDropzoneAccept } from "uploadthing/client";

import { useUploadThing } from "~/utils/uploadthing";

export function MultiUploader() {
  const [files, setFiles] = useState<File[]>([]);
  const onDrop = useCallback((acceptedFiles: File[]) => {
    setFiles(acceptedFiles);
  }, []);

  const { startUpload, routeConfig } = useUploadThing("myUploadEndpoint", {
    onClientUploadComplete: () => {
      alert("uploaded successfully!");
    },
    onUploadError: () => {
      alert("error occurred while uploading");
    },
    onUploadBegin: ({ file }) => {
      console.log("upload has begun for", file);
    },
  });

  const { getRootProps, getInputProps } = useDropzone({
    onDrop,
    accept: generateClientDropzoneAccept(
      generatePermittedFileTypes(routeConfig).fileTypes,
    ),
  });

  return (
    <div {...getRootProps()}>
      <input {...getInputProps()} />
      <div>
        {files.length > 0 && (
          <button onClick={() => startUpload(files)}>
            Upload {files.length} files
          </button>
        )}
      </div>
      Drop files here!
    </div>
  );
}
```
