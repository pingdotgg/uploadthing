# SolidStart Setup

## Package Setup

### Install the packages

```bash npm2yarn
npm install uploadthing @uploadthing/solid solidjs-dropzone attr-accept
```

### Add env variables

<Note>
  If you don't already have a uploadthing secret key, [sign
  up](https://uploadthing.com/sign-in) and create one from the
  [dashboard!](https://uploadthing.com/dashboard)
</Note>

```bash
UPLOADTHING_TOKEN=... # A token for interacting with the SDK
```

## Set Up A FileRouter

### Creating your first FileRoute

All files uploaded to uploadthing are associated with a FileRoute. The following
is a very minimalistic example, with a single FileRoute "imageUploader". Think
of a FileRoute similar to an endpoint, it has:

- Permitted types ["image", "video", etc]
- Max file size
- (Optional) `middleware` to authenticate and tag requests
- `onUploadComplete` callback for when uploads are completed

To get full insight into what you can do with the FileRoutes, please refer to
the [File Router API](/file-routes).

```ts {{ title: "src/server/uploadthing.ts" }}
import { createUploadthing, UploadThingError } from "uploadthing/server";
import type { FileRouter } from "uploadthing/server";

const f = createUploadthing();

const auth = (req: Request) => ({ id: "fakeId" }); // Fake auth function

export const uploadRouter = {
  profileImage: f({
    image: {
      maxFileSize: "4MB",
    },
  })
    .middleware(async ({ req }) => {
      // This code runs on your server before upload
      const user = await auth(req);

      // If you throw, the user will not be able to upload
      if (!user) throw new UploadThingError("Unauthorized");

      // Whatever is returned here is accessible in onUploadComplete as `metadata`
      return { userId: user.id };
    })
    .onUploadComplete(({ file, metadata }) => {
      // This code RUNS ON YOUR SERVER after upload
      console.log("Upload complete for userId:", metadata.userId);

      console.log("file url", file.url);

      // !!! Whatever is returned here is sent to the clientside `onClientUploadComplete` callback
      return { uploadedBy: metadata.userId };
    }),
} satisfies FileRouter;

export type OurFileRouter = typeof uploadRouter;
```

### Create an API route using the FileRouter

<Note>
  File path here doesn't matter, you can serve this from any route. We recommend
  serving it from `/api/uploadthing`.
</Note>

```ts {{ title: "src/routes/api/uploadthing.ts" }}
import { createRouteHandler } from "uploadthing/server";

import { uploadRouter } from "~/server/uploadthing";

const handlers = createRouteHandler({
  router: uploadRouter,

  // Apply an (optional) custom config:
  // config: { ... },
});
export { handlers as GET, handlers as POST };
```

> See configuration options in
> [server API reference](/api-reference/server#create-route-handler)

## Creating The UploadThing Components

Generating components let's you pass your generic `FileRouter` once and then
have typesafe components everywhere, instead of having to pass the generic
everytime you mount a component, but you can also import the components
individually from `@uploadthing/solid`.

```ts {{ title: "src/utils/uploadthing.ts" }}
import {
  generateUploadButton,
  generateUploadDropzone,
} from "@uploadthing/solid";

import type { OurFileRouter } from "~/server/uploadthing";

// URL is only needed for server side rendering, or when your router
// is deployed on a different path than `/api/uploadthing`
const url = `http://localhost:${process.env.PORT ?? 3000}`;

export const UploadButton = generateUploadButton<OurFileRouter>({ url });
export const UploadDropzone = generateUploadDropzone<OurFileRouter>({ url });
```

### Add UploadThing's Styles

<Tabs tabs={["Tailwind", "Not Tailwind"]}>
  <Tab>
      Wrap your Tailwind config with the `withUt` helper. You can learn more about our
      Tailwind helper in the ["Theming" page](/concepts/theming#theming-with-tailwind-css)

      ```tsx
      import { withUt } from "uploadthing/tw";

      export default withUt({
        // Your existing Tailwind config
        content: ["./src/**/*.{ts,tsx,mdx}"],
        ...
      });
      ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    Include our CSS file in the root layout to make sure the components look right!

    ```tsx
    import "@uploadthing/solid/styles.css";
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Use the FileRouter in your app

UploadThing provides a few premade components that you can use to upload files
in your app. For component customization, see [Theming](/concepts/theming), and
for even more advanced use cases check out the
[hook usage](#advanced-usage-use-upload-thing)

### UploadButton

A simple button that opens the native file picker when clicked. It lists what
files are allowed and how many files can be uploaded of that type.

{/* using React package since Nextra can't mount Solid components, but they look the same */}

import { UploadButton } from "@uploadthing/react";

<UploadButton
  __internal_button_disabled
  __internal_state="ready"
  content={{
    allowedContent: "Allowed content",
    button: "Ready",
  }}
/>

```tsx
// Or import from your typed, generated components
import { UploadButton } from "@uploadthing/solid";

import type { OurFileRouter } from "~/server/uploadthing";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main>
      <UploadButton<OurFileRouter>
        endpoint="profileImage"
        // needed when server side rendering
        url="http://localhost:3000"
        onClientUploadComplete={() => {
          alert("Upload Completed");
        }}
        onUploadError={(error: Error) => {
          // Do something with the error.
          alert(`ERROR! ${error.message}`);
        }}
      />
    </main>
  );
}
```

### UploadDropzone

This is a SolidJS dropzone component that you can use to upload files, you can
drag files into it.

import { UploadDropzone } from "@uploadthing/react";

<UploadDropzone
  __internal_state="ready"
  __internal_button_disabled
  __internal_dropzone_disabled
  __internal_show_button
  content={{
    allowedContent: "Allowed content",
    button: "Ready",
  }}
/>

```tsx
// Or import from your typed, generated components
import { UploadDropzone } from "@uploadthing/solid";

import type { OurFileRouter } from "~/server/uploadthing";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main>
      <UploadDropzone<OurFileRouter>
        endpoint="profileImage"
        // needed when server side rendering
        url="http://localhost:3000"
        onClientUploadComplete={() => {
          alert("Upload Completed");
        }}
        onUploadError={(error: Error) => {
          // Do something with the error.
          alert(`ERROR! ${error.message}`);
        }}
      />
    </main>
  );
}
```

### Uploader

A combination of the `UploadButton` and `UploadDropzone` components.

```tsx
// Or import from your typed, generated components
import { Uploader } from "@uploadthing/solid";

import type { OurFileRouter } from "~/server/uploadthing";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main>
      <Uploader<OurFileRouter>
        endpoint="profileImage"
        // needed when server side rendering
        url="http://localhost:3000"
        onClientUploadComplete={() => {
          alert("Upload Completed");
        }}
      />
    </main>
  );
}
```

## Advanced usage: `useUploadThing`

For advanced use cases, the premade components might not be flexible enough to
suit your needs. In that case, you can use the `useUploadThing` hook to build
your own components with a custom upload flow:

### Create the hook

First, generate a typed hook using the `generateSolidHelpers` function from
`@uploadthing/solid`:

```tsx {{ title: "src/utils/uploadthing.ts" }}
import { generateSolidHelpers } from "@uploadthing/solid";

import type { OurFileRouter } from "~/server/uploadthing";

export const { useUploadThing } = generateSolidHelpers<OurFileRouter>();
```

### Use the hook

Then, use the hook in your component. By using the hook, you have full control
of when and how to upload files.

```tsx {{ title: "src/routes/index.tsx" }}
import { useUploadThing } from "~/utils/uploadthing";

async function compress(file: File) {
  // Run some compression algorithm on the file
  return file;
}

export default function Home() {
  const { startUpload } = useUploadThing("profileImage", {
    onClientUploadComplete: () => {
      alert("Upload Completed");
    },
  });

  return (
    <main>
      <input
        type="file"
        onChange={async (e) => {
          const file = e.target.files?.[0];
          if (!file) return;

          // Do something with the file before uploading
          const compressed = await compress(file);

          // Then start the upload of the compressed file
          await startUpload([compressed]);
        }}
      />
    </main>
  );
}
```
