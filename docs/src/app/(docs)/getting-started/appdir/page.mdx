# Next.js App Router Setup

Oh, a little bleeding edge are we? We're big fans of `app/` and server
components, and we think you'll love what we've built 🙏

## Setting up your environment

### Install the packages

```bash npm2yarn
npm install uploadthing @uploadthing/react
```

### Add env variables

```bash {{ title: '.env' }}
UPLOADTHING_TOKEN=... # A token for interacting with the SDK
```

<Note>
  If you don't already have a uploadthing secret key, [sign
  up](https://uploadthing.com/sign-in) and create one from the
  [dashboard!](https://uploadthing.com/dashboard)
</Note>

## Set Up A FileRouter

### Creating your first FileRoute

All files uploaded to uploadthing are associated with a FileRoute. The following
is a very minimalistic example, with a single FileRoute "imageUploader". Think
of a FileRoute similar to an endpoint, it has:

- Permitted types ["image", "video", etc]
- Max file size
- (Optional) `middleware` to authenticate and tag requests
- `onUploadComplete` callback for when uploads are completed

To get full insight into what you can do with the FileRoutes, please refer to
the [File Router API](/file-routes).

```ts {{ title: 'app/api/uploadthing/core.ts' }}
import { createUploadthing, type FileRouter } from 'uploadthing/next'
import { UploadThingError } from 'uploadthing/server'

const f = createUploadthing()

const auth = (req: Request) => ({ id: 'fakeId' }) // Fake auth function

// FileRouter for your app, can contain multiple FileRoutes
export const ourFileRouter = {
  // Define as many FileRoutes as you like, each with a unique routeSlug
  imageUploader: f({ image: { maxFileSize: '4MB' } })
    // Set permissions and file types for this FileRoute
    .middleware(async ({ req }) => {
      // This code runs on your server before upload
      const user = await auth(req)

      // If you throw, the user will not be able to upload
      if (!user) throw new UploadThingError('Unauthorized')

      // Whatever is returned here is accessible in onUploadComplete as `metadata`
      return { userId: user.id }
    })
    .onUploadComplete(async ({ metadata, file }) => {
      // This code RUNS ON YOUR SERVER after upload
      console.log('Upload complete for userId:', metadata.userId)

      console.log('file url', file.url)

      // !!! Whatever is returned here is sent to the clientside `onClientUploadComplete` callback
      return { uploadedBy: metadata.userId }
    }),
} satisfies FileRouter

export type OurFileRouter = typeof ourFileRouter
```

### Create a Next.js API route using the FileRouter

<Note>
  File path here doesn't matter, you can serve this from any route. We recommend
  serving it from `/api/uploadthing`.
</Note>

```ts {{ title: 'app/api/uploadthing/route.ts' }}
import { createRouteHandler } from 'uploadthing/next'

import { ourFileRouter } from './core'

// Export routes for Next App Router
export const { GET, POST } = createRouteHandler({
  router: ourFileRouter,

  // Apply an (optional) custom config:
  // config: { ... },
})
```

> See configuration options in
> [server API reference](/api-reference/server#create-route-handler)

## Create The UploadThing Components

We provide components to make uploading easier. We **highly recommend
re-exporting them with the types assigned**, but you CAN import the components
individually from `@uploadthing/react` instead.

```ts {{ title: 'src/utils/uploadthing.ts' }}
import {
  generateUploadButton,
  generateUploadDropzone,
} from '@uploadthing/react'

import type { OurFileRouter } from '~/app/api/uploadthing/core'

export const UploadButton = generateUploadButton<OurFileRouter>()
export const UploadDropzone = generateUploadDropzone<OurFileRouter>()
```

### Add UploadThing's Styles

<Tabs tabs={["Tailwind", "Not Tailwind"]}>
    <Tab>
      Wrap your Tailwind config with the `withUt` helper. You can learn more about our
      Tailwind helper in the ["Theming" page](/concepts/theming#theming-with-tailwind-css)

      ```tsx
      import { withUt } from "uploadthing/tw";

      export default withUt({
        // Your existing Tailwind config
        content: ["./src/**/*.{ts,tsx,mdx}"],
        ...
      });
      ```

    </Tab>
    <Tab>
      Include our CSS file in the root layout to make sure the components look right!

      ```tsx
      import "@uploadthing/react/styles.css";
      ```

    </Tab>

</Tabs>

## Mount A Button And Upload!

<Warning>
  Don't forget to add the `"use client;"` directive at the top of your file,
  since the `UploadButton` component needs to run on the client-side.
</Warning>

```tsx {{ title: "app/example-uploader/page.tsx" }}
'use client'

import { UploadButton } from '~/utils/uploadthing'

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main className="flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center justify-between p-24">
      <UploadButton
        endpoint="imageUploader"
        onClientUploadComplete={(res) => {
          // Do something with the response
          console.log('Files: ', res)
          alert('Upload Completed')
        }}
        onUploadError={(error: Error) => {
          // Do something with the error.
          alert(`ERROR! ${error.message}`)
        }}
      />
    </main>
  )
}
```

## Improving SSR {{ label: '💡 Optional' }}

UploadThing needs to get info from your server to get permissions info. Normally
this means a loading state. We built an optional plugin to prevent that

import { WithoutSSR, WithSSR } from '@/components/SSRDiff'

<div className="mt-6 flex items-center justify-center gap-8">
  <WithoutSSR />
  <WithSSR />
</div>

To add SSR hydration and avoid that loading state, simply render the
`<NextSSRPlugin />` hydration helper in the body of your root layout **before**
the children.

```tsx {{title: "app/layout.tsx" }}
import { NextSSRPlugin } from '@uploadthing/react/next-ssr-plugin'
import { extractRouterConfig } from 'uploadthing/server'

import { ourFileRouter } from '~/app/api/uploadthing/core'

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <NextSSRPlugin
          /**
           * The `extractRouterConfig` will extract **only** the route configs
           * from the router to prevent additional information from being
           * leaked to the client. The data passed to the client is the same
           * as if you were to fetch `/api/uploadthing` directly.
           */
          routerConfig={extractRouterConfig(ourFileRouter)}
        />
        {children}
      </body>
    </html>
  )
}
```
