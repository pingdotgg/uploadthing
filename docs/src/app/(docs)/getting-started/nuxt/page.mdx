# Getting Started using Nuxt

The UploadThing Nuxt module makes it super easy to get started with uploading in
Nuxt apps. It is a wrapper around `@uploadthing/vue` and the H3 backend adapter.

<Note>
  Check out a full example
  [here](https://github.com/pingdotgg/uploadthing/tree/Mr0Bread/nuxt-support/examples/minimal-nuxt)
</Note>
<Note>
  Using standalone Vue without Nuxt? Checkout the standalone example
  [here](https://github.com/pingdotgg/uploadthing/tree/Mr0Bread/nuxt-support/examples/backend-adapters/client-vue)
</Note>

## Package Setup

### Install the packages

```bash npm2yarn
npm install uploadthing @uploadthing/nuxt
```

### Add env variables

```bash
NUXT_UPLOADTHING_TOKEN=... # A token for interacting with the SDK
# 👆 NUXT_ prefix is **important**
```

<Warning>
  If you don't already have a uploadthing secret key, [sign
  up](https://uploadthing.com/sign-in) and create one from the
  [dashboard!](https://uploadthing.com/dashboard)
</Warning>

## Initialize the Uploadthing module

Add the `@uploadthing/nuxt` module to your `nuxt.config.ts` file:

```ts {{ title: "nuxt.config.ts" }}
export default {
  modules: ['@uploadthing/nuxt'],
  uploadthing: {
    /**
     * Path to your router definition file
     * @default `~/server/uploadthing.ts`
     */
    routerPath: '',
  },
}
```

You can set some module options in the `uploadthing` property of your
`nuxt.config.ts` file:

```ts
/**
 * See https://docs.uploadthing.com/api-reference/server#createroutehandler
 * for more information about the `RouteHandlerConfig` options.
 */
export type ModuleOptions = RouteHandlerConfig & {
  /**
   * Path to your router definition file
   * @default `~/server/uploadthing.ts`
   */
  routerPath?: string
}
```

## Set Up A FileRouter

All files uploaded to uploadthing are associated with a FileRoute. The following
is a very minimalistic example, with a single FileRoute "imageUploader". Think
of a FileRoute similar to an endpoint, it has:

- Permitted types ["image", "video", etc]
- Max file size
- (Optional) `middleware` to authenticate and tag requests
- `onUploadComplete` callback for when uploads are completed

To get full insight into what you can do with the FileRoutes, please refer to
the [File Router API](/file-routes).

<Note>
  It is import you export the router as `uploadRouter` and the inferred type as
  `UploadRouter` for the module to pick up your router and it's types.
</Note>

```ts {{ title: "src/lib/server/uploadthing.ts" }}
import type { H3Event } from 'h3'

import { createUploadthing } from 'uploadthing/h3'
import type { FileRouter } from 'uploadthing/h3'

const f = createUploadthing()

const auth = (ev: H3Event) => ({ id: 'fakeId' }) // Fake auth function

// FileRouter for your app, can contain multiple FileRoutes
export const uploadRouter = {
  // Define as many FileRoutes as you like, each with a unique routeSlug
  imageUploader: f({ image: { maxFileSize: '4MB' } })
    // Set permissions and file types for this FileRoute
    .middleware(async ({ event }) => {
      // This code runs on your server before upload
      const user = await auth(event)

      // If you throw, the user will not be able to upload
      if (!user) throw new Error('Unauthorized')

      // Whatever is returned here is accessible in onUploadComplete as `metadata`
      return { userId: user.id }
    })
    .onUploadComplete(async ({ metadata, file }) => {
      // This code RUNS ON YOUR SERVER after upload
      console.log('Upload complete for userId:', metadata.userId)

      console.log('file url', file.url)
    }),
} satisfies FileRouter

export type UploadRouter = typeof uploadRouter
```

## Upload some files!

Just mount one of our components in your app and start uploading files!

```vue {{ title: "pages/index.vue" }}
<script setup lang="ts">
const alert = (msg: string) => {
  window.alert(msg)
}
</script>

<template>
  <div>
    <UploadButton
      :config="{
        endpoint: 'imageUploader',
        onClientUploadComplete: (file) => {
          console.log('uploaded', file)
          alert('Upload complete')
        },
        onUploadError: (error) => {
          console.error(error, error.cause)
          alert('Upload failed')
        },
      }"
    />
    <UploadDropzone
      :config="{
        endpoint: 'imageUploader',
        onClientUploadComplete: (file) => {
          console.log('uploaded', file)
          alert('Upload complete')
        },
        onUploadError: (error) => {
          console.error(error, error.cause)
          alert('Upload failed')
        },
      }"
    />
  </div>
</template>
```

<Note>
  For component API reference, refer to [the React API
  reference](/api-reference/react). Framework specific docs will be added soon.
</Note>

## Custom flows with the `useUploadThing` composable

If the premade components don't fit your needs, you can use the `useUploadThing`
to create your own custom components.

```vue {{ title: "pages/index.vue" }}
<script setup lang="ts">
const alert = (msg: string) => {
  window.alert(msg)
}

const { startUpload } = useUploadThing('videoAndImage', {
  onClientUploadComplete(res) {
    console.log(`onClientUploadComplete`, res)
    alert('Upload Completed')
  },
})
</script>

<template>
  <label>
    <input
      type="file"
      @change="
        async (e) => {
          console.log(`e`, e)
          const file = (e.target as HTMLInputElement).files?.[0]
          if (!file) return

          // Do something with files

          // Then start the upload
          await startUpload([file])
        }
      "
    />
  </label>
</template>
```
