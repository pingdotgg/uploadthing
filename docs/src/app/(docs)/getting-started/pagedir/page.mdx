# Next.js Pages Router Setup

No shame in using Page Router still! We still use it for a lot of things at Ping
ðŸ˜Š. If your code is still mostly served from the `pages/` directory, this is
where you want to be

## Setting up your environment

### Install the packages

```bash npm2yarn
npm install uploadthing @uploadthing/react
```

### Add env variables

```bash
UPLOADTHING_TOKEN=... # A token for interacting with the SDK
```

<Note>
  If you don't already have a uploadthing secret key, [sign
  up](https://uploadthing.com/sign-in) and create one from the
  [dashboard!](https://uploadthing.com/dashboard)
</Note>

## Set Up A FileRouter

### Creating your first FileRoute

All files uploaded to uploadthing are associated with a FileRoute. The following
is a very minimalistic example, with a single FileRoute "imageUploader". Think
of a FileRoute similar to an endpoint, it has:

- Permitted types ["image", "video", etc]
- Max file size
- How many files are allowed to be uploaded
- (Optional) `input` validation to validate client-side data sent to the route
- (Optional) `middleware` to authenticate and tag requests
- `onUploadComplete` callback for when uploads are completed

To get full insight into what you can do with the FileRoutes, please refer to
the [File Router API](/file-routes).

```tsx {{ title: "server/uploadthing.ts" }}
import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from "next";

import { createUploadthing, type FileRouter } from "uploadthing/next-legacy";
import { UploadThingError } from "uploadthing/server";

const f = createUploadthing();

const auth = (req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) => ({ id: "fakeId" }); // Fake auth function

// FileRouter for your app, can contain multiple FileRoutes
export const ourFileRouter = {
  // Define as many FileRoutes as you like, each with a unique routeSlug
  imageUploader: f({
    image: {
      /**
       * For full list of options and defaults, see the File Route API reference
       * @see https://docs.uploadthing.com/file-routes#route-config
       */
      maxFileSize: "4MB",
      maxFileCount: 1,
    },
  })
    // Set permissions and file types for this FileRoute
    .middleware(async ({ req, res }) => {
      // This code runs on your server before upload
      const user = await auth(req, res);

      // If you throw, the user will not be able to upload
      if (!user) throw new UploadThingError("Unauthorized");

      // Whatever is returned here is accessible in onUploadComplete as `metadata`
      return { userId: user.id };
    })
    .onUploadComplete(async ({ metadata, file }) => {
      // This code RUNS ON YOUR SERVER after upload
      console.log("Upload complete for userId:", metadata.userId);

      console.log("file url", file.url);

      // !!! Whatever is returned here is sent to the clientside `onClientUploadComplete` callback
      return { uploadedBy: metadata.userId };
    }),
} satisfies FileRouter;

export type OurFileRouter = typeof ourFileRouter;
```

### Create a Next.js API route using the FileRouter

<Note>
  File path here doesn't matter, you can serve this from any route. We recommend
  serving it from `/api/uploadthing`.
</Note>

```ts {{ title: "pages/api/uploadthing.ts" }}
import { createRouteHandler } from "uploadthing/next-legacy";

import { ourFileRouter } from "~/server/uploadthing";

export default createRouteHandler({
  router: ourFileRouter,

  // Apply an (optional) custom config:
  // config: { ... },
});
```

> See configuration options in
> [server API reference](/api-reference/server#create-route-handler)

## Create The UploadThing Components

```ts {{ title: "src/utils/uploadthing.ts" }}
import {
  generateUploadButton,
  generateUploadDropzone,
} from "@uploadthing/react";

import type { OurFileRouter } from "~/server/uploadthing";

export const UploadButton = generateUploadButton<OurFileRouter>();
export const UploadDropzone = generateUploadDropzone<OurFileRouter>();
```

### Add UploadThing's Styles

<Tabs tabs={["Tailwind", "Not Tailwind"]}>
  <Tab>
      Wrap your Tailwind config with the `withUt` helper. You can learn more about our
      Tailwind helper in the ["Theming" page](/concepts/theming#theming-with-tailwind-css)

      ```tsx
      import { withUt } from "uploadthing/tw";

      export default withUt({
        // Your existing Tailwind config
        content: ["./src/**/*.{ts,tsx,mdx}"],
        ...
      });
      ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    Include our CSS file in the root layout to make sure the components look right!

    ```tsx
    import "@uploadthing/react/styles.css";
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Mount A Button And Upload!

The `@uploadthing/react` package includes an "UploadButton" component that you
can simply drop into your app, and start uploading files immediately.

```tsx {{ title: "app/example-uploader.tsx" }}
import { UploadButton } from "~/utils/uploadthing";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main className="flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center justify-between p-24">
      <UploadButton
        endpoint="imageUploader"
        onClientUploadComplete={(res) => {
          // Do something with the response
          console.log("Files: ", res);
          alert("Upload Completed");
        }}
        onUploadError={(error: Error) => {
          // Do something with the error.
          alert(`ERROR! ${error.message}`);
        }}
      />
    </main>
  );
}
```
