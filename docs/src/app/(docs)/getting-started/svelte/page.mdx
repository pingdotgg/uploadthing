# Getting Started with SvelteKit

## Package Setup

### Install the packages

```bash npm2yarn
npm install uploadthing @uploadthing/svelte
```

### Add env variables

```bash
UPLOADTHING_TOKEN=... # A token for interacting with the SDK
```

<Warning>
  If you don't already have a uploadthing secret key, [sign
  up](https://uploadthing.com/sign-in) and create one from the
  [dashboard!](https://uploadthing.com/dashboard)
</Warning>

## Set Up A FileRouter

### Creating your first FileRoute

All files uploaded to uploadthing are associated with a FileRoute. The following
is a very minimalistic example, with a single FileRoute "imageUploader". Think
of a FileRoute similar to an endpoint, it has:

- Permitted types ["image", "video", etc]
- Max file size
- How many files are allowed to be uploaded
- (Optional) `input` validation to validate client-side data sent to the route
- (Optional) `middleware` to authenticate and tag requests
- `onUploadComplete` callback for when uploads are completed

To get full insight into what you can do with the FileRoutes, please refer to
the [File Router API](/file-routes).

```ts {{ title: "src/lib/server/uploadthing.ts" }}
import { createUploadthing } from "uploadthing/server";
import type { FileRouter } from "uploadthing/server";

const f = createUploadthing();

const auth = (req: Request) => ({ id: "fakeId" }); // Fake auth function

// FileRouter for your app, can contain multiple FileRoutes
export const ourFileRouter = {
  // Define as many FileRoutes as you like, each with a unique routeSlug
  imageUploader: f({
    image: {
      /**
       * For full list of options and defaults, see the File Route API reference
       * @see https://docs.uploadthing.com/file-routes#route-config
       */
      maxFileSize: "4MB",
      maxFileCount: 1,
    },
  })
    // Set permissions and file types for this FileRoute
    .middleware(async ({ req }) => {
      // This code runs on your server before upload
      const user = await auth(req);

      // If you throw, the user will not be able to upload
      if (!user) throw new Error("Unauthorized");

      // Whatever is returned here is accessible in onUploadComplete as `metadata`
      return { userId: user.id };
    })
    .onUploadComplete(async ({ metadata, file }) => {
      // This code RUNS ON YOUR SERVER after upload
      console.log("Upload complete for userId:", metadata.userId);

      console.log("file url", file.url);
    }),
} satisfies FileRouter;

export type OurFileRouter = typeof ourFileRouter;
```

### Create an API route using the FileRouter

<Note>
  File path here doesn't matter, you can serve this from any route. We recommend
  serving it from `/api/uploadthing`.
</Note>

```ts {{ title: "src/routes/api/uploadthing/+server.ts" }}
import { env } from "$env/dynamic/private";
import { ourFileRouter } from "$lib/server/uploadthing";

import { createRouteHandler } from "uploadthing/server";

const handlers = createRouteHandler({
  router: ourFileRouter,
  config: {
    token: env.UPLOADTHING_TOKEN,
  },
});

export { handlers as GET, handlers as POST };
```

> See configuration options in
> [server API reference](/api-reference/server#create-route-handler)

## Creating the UploadThing Helpers

Generating the `createUploadThing` helper function lets you create your own
components, with full type safety:

```ts {{ title: "src/lib/utils/uploadthing.ts" }}
import type { OurFileRouter } from "$lib/server/uploadthing";

import { generateSvelteHelpers } from "@uploadthing/svelte";

export const { createUploader, createUploadThing } =
  generateSvelteHelpers<OurFileRouter>();
```

### Add UploadThing's Styles

<Tabs tabs={["Tailwind", "Not Tailwind"]}>
  <Tab>
      Wrap your Tailwind config with the `withUt` helper. You can learn more about our
      Tailwind helper in the ["Theming" page](/concepts/theming#theming-with-tailwind-css)

      ```tsx
      import { withUt } from "uploadthing/tw";

      export default withUt({
        // Your existing Tailwind config
        content: ["./src/**/*.{ts,tsx,mdx}"],
        ...
      });
      ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    Include our CSS file in the root layout to make sure the components look right!

    ```svelte
    <script lang="ts">
        import "@uploadthing/svelte/styles.css";
    </script>
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Use the FileRouter in your app

The `@uploadthing/svelte` package includes an "Uploader" component that you can
simply drop into your app, and start uploading files immediately. To create the
"Uploader" props you can use the "createUploader" helper you generated in the
previous step.

```svelte {{ title: "src/routes/+page.svelte" }}
<script lang="ts">
  import { createUploader } from "$lib/utils/uploadthing";

  import { Uploader } from "@uploadthing/svelte";

  const uploader = createUploader("imageUploader", {
    onClientUploadComplete: (res) => {
      console.log(`onClientUploadComplete`, res);
      alert("Upload Completed");
    },
    onUploadError: (error: Error) => {
      alert(`ERROR! ${error.message}`);
    },
  });
</script>

<main>
  <Uploader {uploader} />
</main>
```

You can also choose to use the "UploadButton" and "UploadDropzone" components
separately. Both are included in the `@uploadthing/svelte` package.

```svelte {{ title: "src/routes/+page.svelte" }}
<script lang="ts">
  import { createUploader } from "$lib/utils/uploadthing";

  import { Uploader } from "@uploadthing/svelte";

  const uploader = createUploader("imageUploader", {
    onClientUploadComplete: (res) => {
      console.log(`onClientUploadComplete`, res);
      alert("Upload Completed");
    },
    onUploadError: (error: Error) => {
      alert(`ERROR! ${error.message}`);
    },
  });
</script>

<div class="ut-flex ut-flex-col ut-items-center ut-justify-center ut-gap-4">
  <span class="ut-text-center ut-text-4xl ut-font-bold">
    {`Upload a file using a button:`}
  </span>
  <UploadButton {uploader} />
</div>
<div class="ut-flex ut-flex-col ut-items-center ut-justify-center ut-gap-4">
  <span class="ut-text-center ut-text-4xl ut-font-bold">
    {`...or using a dropzone:`}
  </span>
  <UploadDropzone {uploader} />
</div>
```

## Advanced usage: `createUploadThing`

For advanced use cases, the premade components might not be flexible enough to
suit your needs. In that case, you can use the `createUploadThing` helper
function to build your own components with a custom upload flow:

### Create the `createUploadThing` helper

First, generate a typed helper using the `generateSvelteHelpers` function from
`@uploadthing/svelte` as show above.

### Use the helper

```svelte {{ title: "src/routes/+page.svelte" }}
<script lang="ts">
  import { createUploadThing } from "$lib/utils/uploadthing";

  const { startUpload } = createUploadThing("imageUploader", {
    onClientUploadComplete: () => {
      alert("Upload Completed");
    },
  });
</script>

<input
  type="file"
  on:change={async (e) => {
    const file = e.currentTarget.files?.[0];
    if (!file) return;

    // Do something with files

    // Then start the upload
    await startUpload([file]);
  }}
/>
```

## Theming Svelte components

Check out our [theming guide](/concepts/theming) to know the basics about
[components anatomy](/concepts/theming#upload-button-anatomy) and
[theming props](/concepts/theming#theming-props) as they still apply to
`@uploadthing/svelte`.

However, [content customization](/concepts/theming#content-customization) makes
use of Svelte's named slots and slot props.

### UploadButton content customization

```svelte
<UploadButton {uploader}>
  <span slot="button-content" let:state>
    {state.isUploading ? "Uploading..." : "Pick a file"}
  </span>
  <span slot="clear-btn" let:state>
    Clear files
  </span>
  <span slot="allowed-content" let:state>
    You can choose between {state.fileTypes.join(", ")} files
  </span>
</UploadButton>
```

### UploadDropzone content customization

```svelte
<UploadDropzone {uploader}>
  <i slot="upload-icon" let:state>
    <!-- some custom icon -->
  </i>
  <span slot="button-content" let:state>
    {state.isUploading ? "Uploading..." : "Pick a file"}
  </span>
  <span slot="label" let:state>
    {state.ready ? "Ready to upload" : "Loading..."}
  </span>
  <span slot="allowed-content" let:state>
    You can choose between {state.fileTypes.join(", ")} files
  </span>
</UploadDropzone>
```
