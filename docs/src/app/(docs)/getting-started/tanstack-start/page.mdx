# Getting Started with Tanstack/Start

## Package Setup

### Install the packages

```bash npm2yarn
npm install uploadthing @uploadthing/react
```

### Add env variables

```bash
UPLOADTHING_TOKEN=... # A token for interacting with the SDK
```

<Warning>
  If you don't already have a uploadthing token, [sign
  up](https://uploadthing.com/sign-in) and create one from the
  [dashboard!](https://uploadthing.com/dashboard)
</Warning>

## Set Up A FileRouter

### Creating your first FileRoute

All files uploaded to uploadthing are associated with a FileRoute. The following
is a very minimalistic example, with a single FileRoute "imageUploader". Think
of a FileRoute similar to an endpoint, it has:

- Permitted types ["image", "video", etc]
- Max file size
- (Optional) `middleware` to authenticate and tag requests
- `onUploadComplete` callback for when uploads are completed

To get full insight into what you can do with the FileRoutes, please refer to
the [File Router API](/file-routes).

```ts {{ title: "app/server/uploadthing.ts" }}
import { createUploadthing } from "uploadthing/server";
import type { FileRouter } from "uploadthing/server";

const f = createUploadthing();

const auth = (req: Request) => ({ id: "fakeId" }); // Fake auth function

// FileRouter for your app, can contain multiple FileRoutes
export const ourFileRouter = {
  // Define as many FileRoutes as you like, each with a unique routeSlug
  imageUploader: f({ image: { maxFileSize: "4MB" } })
    // Set permissions and file types for this FileRoute
    .middleware(async ({ req }) => {
      // This code runs on your server before upload
      const user = await auth(req);

      // If you throw, the user will not be able to upload
      if (!user) throw new Error("Unauthorized");

      // Whatever is returned here is accessible in onUploadComplete as `metadata`
      return { userId: user.id };
    })
    .onUploadComplete(async ({ metadata, file }) => {
      // This code RUNS ON YOUR SERVER after upload
      console.log("Upload complete for userId:", metadata.userId);

      console.log("file url", file.url);
    }),
} satisfies FileRouter;

export type OurFileRouter = typeof ourFileRouter;
```

### Create an API route using the FileRouter

<Note>
  File path here doesn't matter, you can serve this from any route. We recommend
  serving it from `/api/uploadthing`.
</Note>

<Warning>
  Make sure to configure API entry handler in `app/api.ts`. For more
  information, please refer to the [@tanstack/start
  docs](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/start/api-routes#setting-up-the-entry-handler).
</Warning>

```ts {{ title: "app/routes/api/uploadthing.ts" }}
import { createAPIFileRoute } from "@tanstack/start/api";

import { createRouteHandler } from "uploadthing/server";

import { ourFileRouter } from "~/api/uploadthing";

const handlers = createRouteHandler({ router: ourFileRouter });

export const Route = createAPIFileRoute("/api/uploadthing")({
  GET: handlers,
  POST: handlers,
});
```

> See configuration options in
> [server API reference](/api-reference/server#create-route-handler)

## Creating the UploadThing Helpers

Generating the `createUploadThing` helper function lets you create your own
components, with full type safety:

```ts {{ title: "app/utils/uploadthing.ts" }}
import {
  generateUploadButton,
  generateUploadDropzone,
} from "@uploadthing/react";

import type { OurFileRouter } from "~/api/uploadthing";

export const UploadButton = generateUploadButton<OurFileRouter>();
export const UploadDropzone = generateUploadDropzone<OurFileRouter>();
```

### Add UploadThing's Styles

<Tabs tabs={["Tailwind", "Not Tailwind"]}>
  <Tab>
      Wrap your Tailwind config with the `withUt` helper. You can learn more about our
      Tailwind helper in the ["Theming" page](/concepts/theming#theming-with-tailwind-css)

      ```tsx
      import { withUt } from "uploadthing/tw";

      export default withUt({
        // Your existing Tailwind config
        content: ["./src/**/*.{ts,tsx,mdx}"],
        ...
      });
      ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    Include our CSS file in the root layout to make sure the components look right!

    ```tsx
    import "@uploadthing/react/styles.css";
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Mount A Button And Upload!

```tsx {{ title: "app/routes/index.tsx" }}
import { createFileRoute } from "@tanstack/react-router";

import { UploadButton } from "~/utils/uploadthing";

export const Route = createFileRoute("/")({
  component: Home,
});

function Home() {
  return <UploadButton endpoint="imageUploader" />;
}
```
