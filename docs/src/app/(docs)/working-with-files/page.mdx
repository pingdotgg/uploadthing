# Working with Files

After your files have been uploaded, you will most likely want to do something
with them. This page shows how to work with your uploaded files.

## Accessing Public Files

UploadThing serves all files from a CDN at the following URL pattern:

`https://<APP_ID>.ufs.sh/f/<FILE_KEY>`

If you set a `customId` when uploading the file, you can also use
`https://<APP_ID>.ufs.sh/f/<CUSTOM_ID>` to access it.

<Warning>
    Do not use the raw file URL from the storage provider, e.g. `https://bucket.s3.region.amazonaws.com/<FILE_KEY>`. We reserve the right to move objects between different storage providers and/or buckets, so this URL is not guaranteed to remain valid.
</Warning>

<Note>
  Previously, all files were served from `https://utfs.io/f/<FILE_KEY>`.
  This is still supported, but not recommended and may be deprecated in the future.
</Note>

Given that all files are served from a subdomain of your app, you have granular
control over what URLs are allowed to be processed. Below is an example of how
to setup image optimization allow filtering in Next.js that only allows
optimizing images from your app:

```js
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
export default {
  images: {
    remotePatterns: [
      {
        protocol: "https",
        hostname: "<APP_ID>.ufs.sh",
        pathname: "/f/*",
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

## Accessing Private Files

If your files are protected with
[access controls](/concepts/regions-acl#access-controls), you can generate a
presigned URL using
[`UTApi.generateSignedURL`](/api-reference/ut-api#get-signed-url). Here's a
reference implementation using Node.js crypto:

```ts
import crypto from "node:crypto";

const apiKey = "sk_live_...";
const url = new URL("https://<APP_ID>.ufs.sh/f/<FILE_KEY>");
const algorithm = "hmac-sha256";

// Set expiration to 30 seconds from now (you choose how long you want the URL to be valid for)
const expires = Date.now() + 1000 * 30;
url.searchParams.set("expires", String(expires));

const signature = crypto
  .createHmac(algorithm, apiKey)
  .update(url.href)
  .digest("hex");
url.searchParams.set("signature", `${algorithm}=${signature}`);

// The URL is now signed and ready to use
await fetch(url); // Status 200 OK
```

The URL will be valid for the duration in milliseconds you set in the `expires`
parameter or until the API key is deleted or revoked.

<Note>
  You can also request presigned URLs using the `/requestFileAccess` API
  endpoint (see [OpenAPI Specification](/api-reference/openapi-spec)). However,
  generating URLs client-side is faster as it avoids an additional API call.
</Note>

The presigned URL follows the same patterns as public files, with additional
query parameters to authenticate the request.

## Other File Operations

Please refer to our server SDK, [UTApi](/api-reference/ut-api) for more
information on how to work with files. You can also access the API directly
using the [OpenAPI Specification](/api-reference/openapi-spec).
