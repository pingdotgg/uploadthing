# File Routes

File Routes are the routes you create with the helper instantiated by
[`createUploadthing`](/api-reference/server#create-uploadthing). Think of them
as the "endpoints" for what your users can upload. An object with file routes
constructs a file router where the keys (slugs) in the object are the names of
your endpoints. You can name your routes whatever you want, preferably something
that explains what the route does, e.g. `profilePicture`, `resume`,
`messageAttachment`, etc.

Below you can see an example file router with a few routes:

```ts
import { createUploadthing, type FileRouter } from "uploadthing/server";

const f = createUploadthing();

export const uploadRouter = {
  // Example "profile picture upload" route - these can be named whatever you want!
  profilePicture: f(["image"])
    .middleware(({ req }) => auth(req))
    .onUploadComplete((data) => console.log("file", data)),

  // This route takes an attached image OR video
  messageAttachment: f(["image", "video"])
    .middleware(({ req }) => auth(req))
    .onUploadComplete((data) => console.log("file", data)),

  // Takes exactly ONE image up to 2MB
  strictImageAttachment: f({
    image: { maxFileSize: "2MB", maxFileCount: 1, minFileCount: 1 },
  })
    .middleware(({ req }) => auth(req))
    .onUploadComplete((data) => console.log("file", data)),

  // Takes up to 4 2mb images and/or 1 256mb video
  mediaPost: f({
    image: { maxFileSize: "2MB", maxFileCount: 4 },
    video: { maxFileSize: "256MB", maxFileCount: 1 },
  })
    .middleware(({ req }) => auth(req))
    .onUploadComplete((data) => console.log("file", data)),

  // Takes up to 4 2mb images, and the client will not resolve
  // the upload until the `onUploadComplete` resolved.
  withAwaitedServerData: f(
    { image: { maxFileSize: "2MB", maxFileCount: 4 } },
    { awaitServerData: true },
  )
    .middleware(({ req }) => auth(req))
    .onUploadComplete((data) => {
      return { foo: "bar" as const };
    }),
} satisfies FileRouter;

export type UploadRouter = typeof uploadRouter;
```

## Route Config {{ since: '5.0' }}

The `f` function takes two arguments. The first can be an array of `FileType`,
or a record mapping each `FileType` with a route config. The route config allow
more granular control, for example what files can be uploaded and how many of
them can be uploaded for a given upload. The array syntax will fallback to
applying the [defaults](#defaults) to all file types.

A `FileType` can be any valid [web
MIME
type]((https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_Types).
For example: use `application/json` to only allow JSON files to be uploaded.

Additionally, you may pass any of the following custom types: `image`, `video`,
`audio`, `pdf` or `text`. These are shorthands that allows you to specify the
type of file without specifying the exact MIME type. Lastly, there's `blob`
which allows any file type.

A route config can have the following properties:

<Properties>
  <Property name="maxFileSize" since="5.0" type="FileSize" defaultValue="4MB *">
    The maximum file size for a file of this type. `FileSize` is a string that
    can be parsed as a number followed by a unit of measurement (`B`, `KB`, `MB`, or `GB`)

    \* The default max file size depends on the file type. 4MB is the default unless
    using one of the custom file types:

    | File Type | Default Max Size |
    | :-------- | :--------------- |
    | image     | 4MB              |
    | video     | 16MB             |
    | audio     | 8MB              |
    | blob      | 8MB              |
    | pdf       | 4MB              |
    | text      | 64kB             |

  </Property>
  <Property name="maxFileCount" since="5.0" type="number" defaultValue="1">
    The maximum number of files of this type that can be uploaded.
  </Property>
  <Property name="minFileCount" since="6.8" type="number" defaultValue="1">
    The minimum number of files of this type that must be uploaded.
  </Property>
  <Property
    name="contentDisposition"
    since="5.7"
    type="inline | attachment"
    defaultValue="inline"
  >
    The content disposition to set on the storage provider. Content disposition
    indicates how the file is expected to be displayed in the browser. Read more
    about content disposition on
    [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Disposition).
  </Property>
  <Property name="acl" since="6.0" type="public-read | private">
    The [ACL](/concepts/regions-acl#access-controls) to set on the storage
    provider.
  </Property>
</Properties>

<Note>
  ACL can only be overridden if you have enabled the "Allow Overriding ACL"
  setting on the UploadThing dashboard. Attempts to override the ACL without
  enabling this setting will result in an error.
</Note>

## Route Options {{ since: '7.0' }}

The second argument to the `f` function is an optional object of route options.
Route options are shared configurations for all file types in a route. These
configurations are not bound to a specific type of file that is uploaded, but
will apply to the entire route.

<Properties>
  <Property
    name="awaitServerData"
    since="7.0"
    type="boolean"
    defaultValue="false"
  >
    Set this to `true` to wait for the server onUploadComplete data on the
    client before running `onClientUploadComplete`.
  </Property>
</Properties>

<span className="h-8" />

The `f` function returns a builder object that allows you to chain methods that
will run during the upload process.

```ts
import { z } from "zod";

f(["image"])
  .input(z.object({ foo: z.string() }))
  .middleware(async ({ req, input }) => {
    input;
    // ^? { foo: string }
    return {};
  })
  .onUploadError(({ error, fileKey }) => {})
  .onUploadComplete(async (opts) => {});
```

## `input` {{ since: '5.0' }}

You can pass a [Zod](https://github.com/colinhacks/zod) schema to validate user
input from the client. This data comes from the client when the upload starts.
If validation here fails, an error will be thrown and none of your `middleware`
n'or `onUploadComplete` functions will be executed.

The input is validated on **your** server and only leaves your server if you
pass it along from the `.middleware` to the `.onUploadComplete`. If you only use
the input in the middleware without returning it, the Uploadthing server won't
have any knowledge of it.

## `middleware` {{ since: '5.0' }}

This is the function where you authorize a user to do an upload. You can also
tag the upload with metadata here. Example using Clerk:

```ts
import { currentUser } from "@clerk/nextjs";

import { UploadThingError } from "uploadthing/server";

f(["image"])
  .middleware(async ({ req, res }) => {
    const user = await currentUser();

    // Throw if user isn't signed in
    if (!user)
      throw new UploadThingError(
        "You must be logged in to upload a profile picture",
      );

    // Return userId to be used in onUploadComplete
    return { userId: user.id };
  })
  .onUploadComplete(async ({ metadata }) => {
    console.log("Uploaded by user", metadata.userId);
  });
```

<Note>
  Note: By default, a thrown `UploadThingError`'s message will be sent to the
  client's `onError`. All other errors are turned into generic failure messages
  to avoid leaking sensitive information. Read more about [error handling
  here](/concepts/error-handling).
</Note>

As of `v6.4`, you can also tag your metadata using the `UTFiles` symbol to
override the uploaded files attributes. This can be used to either rename the
file, or set a custom identifer for the file:

```ts
import { UTFiles } from "uploadthing/server";

f(["image"])
  .middleware(async ({ req, files }) => {
    const fileOverrides = files.map((file) => {
      const newName = sluggify(file.name);
      const myIdentifier = generateId();
      return { ...file, name: newName, customId: myIdentifier };
    });

    // Return userId to be used in onUploadComplete
    return { foo: "bar" as const, [UTFiles]: fileOverrides };
  })
  .onUploadComplete(async ({ metadata, file }) => {
    // The UTFIles symbol is stripped from the metadata
    metadata; // { foo: "bar" }
    file.customId; // myIdentifier
  });
```

## `onUploadError` {{ since: '5.5' }}

Called when an error occurs during the upload process.

The function is called with a single object argument with the following
properties:

<Properties>
  <Property name="error" since="5.5" type="UploadThingError">
    The error that occurred.
  </Property>
  <Property name="fileKey" since="5.5" type="string">
    The key of the file that failed to upload.
  </Property>
</Properties>

## `onUploadComplete` {{ since: '5.0' }}

This is the function you use to do something with the uploaded file, such as
persisting it to your database. Whatever you returned in the middleware will be
accessible here. Please note that `onUploadComplete` is the end of the chain,
each route must have one and it must be the last method in the builder chain.

As of v6.0, you can return JSON serializable data from this function, which will
be passed to the clientside `onClientUploadComplete` callback.

The function is called with a single object argument with the following
properties:

<Properties>
  <Property name="metadata" since="5.0" type="Generic">
    The metadata that was returned from the [`middleware`](#middleware)
    function.
  </Property>
  <Property name="file" since="5.0" type="UploadedFileData">
    An object with info for the file that was uploaded, such as the name, key,
    size, url etc.
  </Property>
</Properties>
