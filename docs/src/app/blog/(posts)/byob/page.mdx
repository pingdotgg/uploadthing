## Bring Your Own Bucket (BYOB)

Following up our [recent launch of usage-based pricing](/blog/usage-based),
we're excited to release our highly-requested BYOB feature, giving you full
control over your file storage while maintaining UploadThing's superior
developer experience. With BYOB, you can:

- Store files directly in your own storage infrastructure
- Meet strict compliance requirements
- Maintain complete control over your data

For the initial release, we are launching with support for AWS S3 buckets, with
more storage providers coming soon based on user demand.

### Getting Started with BYOB

BYOB is only available on new apps. Go the the dashboard and create a new app,
select the BYOB tier and follow the instructions to connect your S3 bucket.

[support@uploadthing.com](mailto:support@uploadthing.com).
