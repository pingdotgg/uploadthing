## Usage-based Pricing Is Here!

UploadThing is the best way to add file upload to your apps. Now we'll scale
with you :)

This is one of those "we should have done it awhile ago" ships - but we wanted
to make sure we got it right.

Here's the breakdown:

- $25/month base price
- 250GB storage included
- $0.08 per GB for additional storage

...that's it? Yep. Unlike all of our competitors, we don't charge for things
like seats, requests, or bandwidth. You just pay for the storage used.

Ready to upgrade? Visit your
[settings](https://uploadthing.com/dashboard?s=billing) to switch to usage-based
pricing.

This is part of an ongoing effort to make UploadThing enterprise ready. We've
been dogfooding harder than ever with our new apps
[PicThing](https://pic.ping.gg) and [T3 Chat](https://t3.chat). We're smoothing
out every rough edge we can find.

If we're successful, you'll never have to worry about file storage again,
regardless of the scale you're shipping.

We're so excited to share even more fun enterprise features to UploadThing. Keep
an eye out here and [on our Twitter](https://x.com/pingdotgg) to stay up to date
🙏
