# Getting started with Fetch / Edge Runtimes

UploadThing is compatible with any runtime that follow the
[WinterCG](https://wintercg.org/).

## Common setup

### Package Setup

<Steps>

### Install the package

import { Tab, Tabs } from "nextra-theme-docs";

```sh npm2yarn
npm install uploadthing
```

#### Add env variables

<Callout>
  If you don't already have a uploadthing secret key, [sign
  up](https://uploadthing.com/sign-in) and create one from the
  [dashboard!](https://uploadthing.com/dashboard)
</Callout>

```bash copy
UPLOADTHING_SECRET=... # A secret key for your app (starts with sk_live_)
UPLOADTHING_APP_ID=... # Your app id
```

### Set Up A FileRouter

All files uploaded to uploadthing are associated with a FileRoute. Following
example is very minimalistic. To get full insight into what you can do with the
FileRoutes, please refer to the
[File Router API](/api-reference/server#file-routes).

```ts copy filename="uploadthing.ts"
import { createUploadthing, type FileRouter } from "uploadthing/server";

const f = createUploadthing();

export const uploadRouter = {
  videoAndImage: f({
    image: {
      maxFileSize: "4MB",
      maxFileCount: 4,
    },
    video: {
      maxFileSize: "16MB",
    },
  }).onUploadComplete((data) => {
    console.log("upload completed", data);
  }),
} satisfies FileRouter;

export type OurFileRouter = typeof uploadRouter;
```

</Steps>

## Runtimes-specific setup

### Astro

```ts filename="pages/api/uploadthing.ts"
import { createServerHandler } from "uploadthing/server";

import { uploadRouter } from "../../server/uploadthing";

export const { GET, POST } = createServerHandler({
  router: uploadRouter,
  config: {
    uploadthingId: import.meta.env.UPLOADTHING_APPID,
    uploadthingSecret: import.meta.env.UPLOADTHING_SECRET,
    callbackUrl: "http://localhost:4321/api/uploadthing",
  },
});
```

### Elysia

```ts filename="src/index.ts"
import { Elysia } from "elysia";

import { createServerHandler } from "uploadthing/server";

import { uploadRouter } from "./uploadthing.ts";

const { GET, POST } = createServerHandler({
  router: uploadRouter,
});

const app = new Elysia().get("/", () => "Hello Elysia");

app.group("/api/uploadthing", (app) =>
  app
    .post("/", (context) => POST(context.request))
    .get("/", (context) => GET(context.request)),
);

app.listen(3000);
```

### Hono

```ts filename="src/index.ts"
import { Hono } from "hono";

import { createServerHandler } from "uploadthing/server";

import { uploadRouter } from "./uploadthing.ts";

const { GET, POST } = createServerHandler({
  router: uploadRouter,
});

const app = new Hono();

const ut = new Hono()
  .get("/", (context) => GET(context.req.raw))
  .post("/", (context) => POST(context.req.raw));

app.route("/api/uploadthing", ut);

export default app;
```

### Cloudflare Workers

```ts filename="src/worker.ts"
import { createServerHandler } from "uploadthing/server";

import { uploadRouter } from "./uploadthing.ts";

export default {
  async fetch(request: Request, env: Env, ctx: ExecutionContext) {
    const handlers = createServerHandler({
      router: uploadRouter,
      config: {
        /**
         * Since workers doesn't have envs on `process`. We need to pass
         * secret and isDev flag manually.
         */
        uploadthingSecret: env.UPLOADTHING_SECRET,
        isDev: env.MODE === "development",
        /*
         * Cloudflare Workers doesn't support the cache option
         * so we need to remove it from the request init.
         */
        fetch: (url, init) => {
          if (init && "cache" in init) delete init.cache;
          return fetch(url, init);
        },
      },
    });

    // World's simplest router. Handle GET/POST requests to /api/uploadthing
    switch (new URL(request.url).pathname) {
      case "/api/uploadthing": {
        if (request.method !== "POST" && request.method !== "GET") {
          return new Response("Method not allowed", { status: 405 });
        }

        const response = await handlers[request.method](request);
        if ("cleanup" in response && response.cleanup) {
          /**
           * UploadThing dev server leaves some promises hanging around that we
           * need to wait for to prevent the worker from exiting prematurely.
           */
          ctx.waitUntil(response.cleanup);
        }
        return response;
      }
      default: {
        return new Response("Not found", { status: 404 });
      }
    }
  },
};
```
