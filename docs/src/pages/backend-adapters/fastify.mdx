## Package Setup

<Steps>

```

  up](https://uploadthing.com/sign-in) and create one from the
  [dashboard!](https://uploadthing.com/dashboard)
</Callout>

```bash copy
UPLOADTHING_SECRET=... # A secret key for your app (starts with sk_live_)
UPLOADTHING_APP_ID=... # Your app id
```

</Steps>

## Set Up A FileRouter

<Steps>

### Creating your first FileRoute

All files uploaded to uploadthing are associated with a FileRoute. Following
example is very minimalistic. To get full insight into what you can do with the
FileRoutes, please refer to the
[File Router API](/api-reference/server#file-routes).

```ts copy filename="src/uploadthing.ts"
import { createUploadthing, type FileRouter } from "uploadthing/fastify";

const f = createUploadthing();

export const uploadRouter = {
  videoAndImage: f({
    image: {
      maxFileSize: "4MB",
      maxFileCount: 4,
    },
    video: {
      maxFileSize: "16MB",
    },
  }).onUploadComplete((data) => {
    console.log("upload completed", data);
  }),
} satisfies FileRouter;

export type OurFileRouter = typeof uploadRouter;
```

### Register the UploadThing plugin

```ts copy filename="src/index.ts"
import Fastify from "fastify";

import { createRouteHandler } from "uploadthing/fastify";

import { uploadRouter } from "./router";

const fastify = Fastify({ logger: true });

fastify
  /** ... */
  .register(createRouteHandler, {
    router: uploadRouter,
    config: { ... },
  });
```

> See configuration options in
> [server API reference](/api-reference/server#createroutehandler)

### Use the FileRouter in your app

Please refer to client side examples:

- [NextJS App directory](/getting-started/appdir#create-the-uploadthing-components-optional)
- [NextJS Pages directory](/getting-started/pagedir#create-the-uploadthing-components-optional)
- [SolidStart](/getting-started/solid#use-the-filerouter-in-your-app)
