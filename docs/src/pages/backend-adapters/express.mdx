# Getting started with Express

> Added in `v5.6`

## Package Setup

<Steps>

### Install the package

```sh npm2yarn
npm install uploadthing
```

### Add env variables

<Callout>
  If you don't already have a uploadthing secret key, [sign
  up](https://uploadthing.com/sign-in) and create one from the
  [dashboard!](https://uploadthing.com/dashboard)
</Callout>

```bash copy
UPLOADTHING_SECRET=... # A secret key for your app (starts with sk_live_)
UPLOADTHING_APP_ID=... # Your app id
```

</Steps>

## Set Up A FileRouter

<Steps>

### Creating your first FileRoute

All files uploaded to uploadthing are associated with a FileRoute. Following
example is very minimalistic. To get full insight into what you can do with the
FileRoutes, please refer to the
[File Router API](/api-reference/server#file-routes).

```ts copy filename="src/uploadthing.ts"
import { createUploadthing, type FileRouter } from "uploadthing/express";

const f = createUploadthing();

export const uploadRouter = {
  videoAndImage: f({
    image: {
      maxFileSize: "4MB",
      maxFileCount: 4,
    },
    video: {
      maxFileSize: "16MB",
    },
  }).onUploadComplete((data) => {
    console.log("upload completed", data);
  }),
} satisfies FileRouter;

export type OurFileRouter = typeof uploadRouter;
```

### Create an API route using the FileRouter

<Callout type="warning">
  Note: You need to serve this API from `/api/uploadthing` on your application.
</Callout>

```ts copy filename="src/index.ts"
import express from "express";

import { createRouteHandler } from "uploadthing/express";

import { uploadRouter } from "./uploadthing";

const app = express();

app.use(
  "/api/uploadthing",
  createRouteHandler({
    router: uploadRouter,
    config: { ... },
  }),
);
```

> See configuration options in
> [server API reference](/api-reference/server#createroutehandler)

### Use the FileRouter in your app

Client side usage differs ever so slightly from the fullstack framework setups
when using a separate backend server. You'll need to set the URL of your server
when you generate the components and helpers.

```tsx
import { generateUploadButton } from "@uploadthing/react";

export const UploadButton = generateUploadButton({
  url: "https://your-server.com/api/uploadthing",
});
// ...
```

<Callout type="info">
  Please note that you might need to setup some CORS rules on your server to
  allow the client to make requests to the server.
</Callout>

For the remaining usage, please refer to client side examples of the fullstack
framework guides:

- [NextJS App directory](/getting-started/appdir#create-the-uploadthing-components-optional)
- [NextJS Pages directory](/getting-started/pagedir#create-the-uploadthing-components-optional)
- [SolidStart](/getting-started/solid#use-the-filerouter-in-your-app)

</Steps>
