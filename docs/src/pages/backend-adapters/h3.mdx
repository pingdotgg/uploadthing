# Getting started with H3

> Added in `v5.7`

H3 is a HTTP framework that powers the web server framework Nitro and other
full-stack frameworks like Nuxt and soon also SolidStart. This adapter will work
for all frameworks that use H3 under the hood.

## Package Setup

<Steps>

### Install the package

```sh npm2yarn
npm install uploadthing
```

### Add env variables

<Callout>
  If you don't already have a uploadthing secret key, [sign
  up](https://uploadthing.com/sign-in) and create one from the
  [dashboard!](https://uploadthing.com/dashboard)
</Callout>

```bash copy
UPLOADTHING_SECRET=... # A secret key for your app (starts with sk_live_)
UPLOADTHING_APP_ID=... # Your app id
```

</Steps>

## Set Up A FileRouter

<Steps>

### Creating your first FileRoute

All files uploaded to uploadthing are associated with a FileRoute. Following
example is very minimalistic. To get full insight into what you can do with the
FileRoutes, please refer to the
[File Router API](/api-reference/server#file-routes).

```ts copy filename="src/uploadthing.ts"
import { createUploadthing, type FileRouter } from "uploadthing/h3";

const f = createUploadthing();

export const uploadRouter = {
  videoAndImage: f({
    image: {
      maxFileSize: "4MB",
      maxFileCount: 4,
    },
    video: {
      maxFileSize: "16MB",
    },
  }).onUploadComplete((data) => {
    console.log("upload completed", data);
  }),
} satisfies FileRouter;

export type OurFileRouter = typeof uploadRouter;
```

### Create the H3 event handlers

<Tabs items={["Vanilla H3", "Nitro", "Nuxt"]}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```ts
    import { createApp, createRouter } from "h3";

    import { createH3EventHandler } from "uploadthing/h3";
    import { uploadRouter } from "./router";

    const app = createApp();
    const router = createRouter();

    router.use(
      "/api/uploadthing",
      createH3EventHandler({ router: uploadRouter })
    );

    app.use(router);

    export { app }; // Run server with e.g. `listhen`
    ```

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```ts filename="routes/api/uploadthing.ts"
    import { createH3EventHandler } from "uploadthing/h3";

    import { uploadRouter } from "./router";

    export default createH3EventHandler({ router: uploadRouter });
    ```

  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```ts filename="server/api/uploadthing.ts"
    import { createH3EventHandler } from "uploadthing/h3";

    import { uploadRouter } from "./router";

    export default createH3EventHandler({ router: uploadRouter });
    ```

  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

### Use the FileRouter in your app

Please refer to client side examples:

<Callout>
  Support for Vue is coming soon which will allow you to use the fullstack
  framework Nuxt with Uploadthing.
