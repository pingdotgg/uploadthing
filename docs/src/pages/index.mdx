These docs assume you're using Next.js - docs for other frameworks coming
soon!

## Package Setup

<Steps>

### Install the packages:

```bash copy
npm install uploadthing @uploadthing/react react-dropzone
```

### Add env variables

```bash copy
UPLOADTHING_SECRET=... # A secret key for your app (starts with sk_live_)
```

<Callout type="warning">
  If you don't already have a uploadthing secret key, [sign up](/create-account) and create one from
  the dashboard!
</Callout>
</Steps>

## Set up in your Next.js application

Continue setting up with either the [App Router](/nextjs/appdir) or [Pages Router (default)](/nextjs/pagedir)
