# What Is UploadThing?

UploadThing is the easiest way to add file uploads to your full stack TypeScript
application. Many services have tried to build a "better S3", but in our
opinion, none found the right compromise of ownership, flexibility and safety.

Doing this well involves getting three key pieces correct: **File Hosting**,
**Server-side Authorization**, and **Client Experience**.

## 1. We Manage File Hosting (Like S3, But Simpler)

Managing files is...annoying, to say the least. That's why we do it for you!
Right now we're
[mostly just wrapping S3 with caching and callbacks](https://github.com/pingdotgg/uploadthing/blob/main/assets/Diagram.png),
but we have some fun stuff planned 🤐.

This is the ONLY thing we charge for, and our
[prices are pretty simple](https://uploadthing.com/pricing)

## 2. Authorize Users On YOUR Server

You don't post to uploadthing.com. You post to `/api/uploadthing` **on your own
service**

We really don't like the idea that easier file uploads means giving up ownership
or control. To use UploadThing, you _have to host the endpoint for it on your
own servers_.

We provide an
[open source server API](https://github.com/pingdotgg/uploadthing/tree/main/packages/uploadthing)
for authenticating and signing uploads in your backend _without your server
processing the file_. This is the best of both worlds, you get **full control**
while **avoiding all the bandwidth costs**.

_btw, it's fully typesafe and ready for auth_ 😉

```ts
  profilePicture: f(["image"])
    .middleware(({ req }) => auth(req))
    .onUploadComplete((data) => console.log("file", data)),
```

## 3. Give Clients A Great Experience

We provide an open source
[React client library](https://github.com/pingdotgg/uploadthing/tree/main/packages/react)
for uploading files from your frontend with convenient components, hooks and
more. Want a quick "upload image" button? Check out `<UploadButton />`. Want a
super customized form with a bulk image uploader? `useUploadThing()` has you
covered.

```tsx
// Using the generic makes this typesafe against YOUR valid upload endpoints
<UploadButton<OurFileRouter>
  endpoint="imageUploader"
  onUploadComplete={(files) => console.log("files", files)}
/>
```
