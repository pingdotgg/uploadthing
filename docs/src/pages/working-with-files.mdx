# Working with Files

After your files have been uploaded, you will most likely want to do something
with them. This page shows how to work with your uploaded files.

## Accessing Files

<Callout type="warning">
    Do not use the raw file URL from the storage provider, e.g. `https://bucket.s3.region.amazonaws.com/<FILE_KEY>`. We reserve the right to move objects between different storage providers and/or buckets, so this URL is not guaranteed to remain valid.
</Callout>

There are multiple ways to access your files. The most generic way is to
construct the URL from the `fileKey` you get back after the file has been
uploaded:

`https://utfs.io/f/<FILE_KEY>`

This URL will always work for public files and is the default URL returned by the API and from
any SDK method. However, sometimes you may want a URL that's scoped to your
application, for example when doing image optimizations and want to filter what
URLs are allowed to be optimized on your server. For this, the following URL can
be used:

`https://utfs.io/a/<APP_ID>/<FILE_KEY>`

By using this URL pattern, you have more granular control over what URLs are
allowed to be optimized. Below is an example of how to setup image optimization
allow filtering in Next.js:

```js
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
export default {
  images: {
    remotePatterns: [
      {
        protocol: "https",
        hostname: "utfs.io",
        pathname: "/a/<APP_ID>/*",
      },
    ],
  },
};
```

<Callout type="info">
    If you set a `customId` when uploading the file, you can also use `https://utfs.io/a/<APP_ID>/<CUSTOM_ID>`.
</Callout>

### Accessing Private Files

If your files are protected with
[access controls](/regions-and-acl#access-controls), you will need to request a
short-lived presigned URL from the API to access the file. You can request one
using [`UTApi.getSignedUrl`](/api-reference/ut-api#getsignedurl), or from the
`/requestFileAccess` API endpoint (see
[OpenAPI Specification](/api-reference/openapi-spec)).

Presigned URL follows the same patterns as above, with additional query
parameters to authenticate the request.

## Other File Operations

Please refer to our server SDK, [UTApi](/api-reference/ut-api) for more
information on how to work with files. You can also access the API directly
using the [OpenAPI Specification](/api-reference/openapi-spec).
