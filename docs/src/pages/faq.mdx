### The UploadThing components look all weird, what's going on?

If the uploadThing components appear unstyled, you might have missed importing 
the CSS file from the React package. Ensure you've added the following line 
to your root `layout.tsx` or `_app.tsx`:

```tsx
import "@uploadthing/react/styles.css";
```

### Some of my other components look weird now... what's up with that?

This can happen due to the order in which styles are imported. To resolve this, 
ensure that the uploadThing styles are imported before your global styles:

```tsx
import "@uploadthing/react/styles.css";
import "../styles/globals.css";
```

### When I upload files, I get the error `Failed to simulate callback for file. Is your webhook configured correctly?`

This error typically indicates an issue where we are unable to query the `/api/uploadthing`
endpoint. Most often, it arises due to an incorrect configuration in `middleware.ts`.

Ensure that `/api/uploadthing` is accessible and NOT blocked by your middleware. 
Remember, this endpoint serves dual purposes: it's a validation endpoint 
for clients and also acts as a webhook for `onUploadComplete` callbacks.
