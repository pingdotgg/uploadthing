### The UploadThing components look all weird, what's going on?

If your components appear unstyled, you likely forgot to import our CSS file
from the React package. Don't forget to add the following to your root
`layout.tsx` or `_app.tsx`:

```tsx
import "@uploadthing/react/styles.css";
```

### Some of my other components look weird now... what's up with that?

You may need to check the order of imports. Making sure that the uploadthing
component styles are imported before others usually does the trick

```tsx
import "@uploadthing/react/styles.css";
import "../styles/globals.css";
```

### When I upload files, I get the error `Failed to simulate callback for file. Is your webhook configured correctly?`

This error is our catch-all if we were unable to query the `/api/uploadthing`
endpoint. Almost every time we've seen someone who has this issue, it's because
their `middleware.ts` is configured incorrectly.

Make sure that `/api/uploadthing` is NOT blocked through your middleware. It
serves as both a validation endpoint from client AND a webhook for the
`onUploadComplete` calls.
