### The UploadThing components look all weird, what's going on?

If your components appear unstyled, you likely forgot to import our CSS file
from the React package. Don't forget to add the following to your root
`layout.tsx` or `_app.tsx`:

```tsx
import "@uploadthing/react/styles.css";
```

### Some of my other components look weird now... what's up with that?

You may need to check the order of imports. Making sure that the uploadthing
component styles are imported before others usually does the trick

```tsx
import "@uploadthing/react/styles.css";
import "../styles/globals.css";
```

### When I upload files, I get the error `Failed to simulate callback for file. Is your webhook configured correctly?`

This error is our catch-all if we were unable to query the `/api/uploadthing`
endpoint. Almost every time we've seen someone who has this issue, it's because
their `middleware.ts` is configured incorrectly.

Make sure that `/api/uploadthing` is NOT blocked through your middleware. It
serves as both a validation endpoint from client AND a webhook for the
`onUploadComplete` calls.

### I'm getting a `Type ... is not assignable to type '"You forgot to pass the generic"'` error

This occurs when you're importing the `UploadButton` or `UploadDropzone`
components from `@uploadthing/react` or `@uploadthing/solid` directly, and not
[generating your own typesafe components](/api-reference/react#generateComponents)
using `generateComponents`. While you can do this, it is not recommended as you
have to provide the generics yourself in order to get full typesafety.

```tsx
import { UploadButton } from "@uploadthing/react";

import type { OurFileRouter } from "~/app/api/uploadthing/core";

<UploadButton<OurFileRouter, "myFileRoute">
  endpoint="myFileRoute"
  // ...
/>;
```

As you can see, it's quite cumbersome having to provide the generics yourself,
especially since the `endpoint` prop must be specified twice due to lack of
partial inference in TypeScript.
