## createUploadthing

The helper function to create an UploadThing instance. MAKE SURE YOU IMPORT IT
FROM THE RIGHT PLACE

## File Routes

File Routes are the routes you create with the helped instantiated by
`createUploadthing`. Think of them as the "endpoints" for what your users can
upload. The keys in the object are the names of your endpoints.

```ts
import { createUploadthing, type FileRouter } from "uploadthing/next";

const f = createUploadthing();

export const ourFileRouter = {
  // Example "profile picture upload" route - these can be named whatever you want!
  profilePicture: f(["image"])
    .middleware(({ req }) => auth(req))
    .onUploadComplete((data) => console.log("file", data)),

  // This route takes an attached image OR video
  messageAttachment: f(["image", "video"])
    .middleware(({ req }) => auth(req))
    .onUploadComplete((data) => console.log("file", data)),

  // Takes ONE image up to 2MB
  strictImageAttachment: f({ image: { maxFileSize: "2MB", maxFileCount: 1 } })
    .middleware(({ req }) => auth(req))
    .onUploadComplete((data) => console.log("file", data)),

  // Takes a 4 2mb images and/or 1 256mb video
  mediaPost: f({
    image: { maxFileSize: "2MB", maxFileCount: 4 },
    video: { maxFileSize: "256MB", maxFileCount: 1 },
  })
    .middleware(({ req }) => auth(req))
    .onUploadComplete((data) => console.log("file", data)),
} satisfies FileRouter;

export type OurFileRouter = typeof ourFileRouter;
```

### Input

```ts
// Your file types can be any of the following
type ValidFileTypes = "image" | "video" | "audio" | "blob";

// The input to your f() function can be an array of file types OR an object of them w/ config
type FileRouterInput =
  | ValidFileTypes[]
  | {
      [key: ValidFileTypes]: {
        maxFileSize?: string;
        maxFileCount?: number;
      };
    };
```

### Defaults

All routes default to a max file count of 1. The file size defaults are below

| File Type | Default Max Size |
| :-------- | :--------------- |
| image     | 4MB              |
| video     | 16MB             |
| audio     | 8MB              |
| blob      | 8MB              |

### `input`

You can pass a `zod` schema to validate user input from the client. This data
comes from the client when the upload starts. If validation here fails, an error
will be thrown and none of your `middleware` n'or `onUploadComplete` functions
will be executed.

The input is validated on **your** server and only leaves your server if you
pass it along from the `.middleware` to the `.onUploadComplete`. If you only use
the input in the middleware without returning it, the Uploadthing server won't
have any knowledge of it.

### `middleware`

This is the function where you authorize a user to do an upload. You can also
tag the upload with metadata here. Example using Clerk:

```ts
import { currentUser } from "@clerk/nextjs";

f(["image"])
  .middleware(async ({ req, res }) => {
    const user = await currentUser();

    // Throw if user isn't signed in
    if (!user)
      throw new Error("You must be logged in to upload a profile picture");

    // Return userId to be used in onUploadComplete
    return { userId: user.id };
  })
  .onUploadComplete(async ({ metadata }) => {
    console.log("Uploaded by user", metadata.userId);
  });
```

### `onUploadComplete`

This is the function you use to do something with the uploaded file, such as
persisting it to your database. Whatever you returned in the middleware will be
accessible here

## `utapi`

The UploadThing API Helper, for use ON YOUR SERVER. It's basically just a REST
API but better

### `deleteFiles`

`deleteFiles` takes in a fileKey or an array of fileKeys and deletes them from
the server.

```ts
import { utapi } from "uploadthing/server";

await utapi.deleteFiles("2e0fdb64-9957-4262-8e45-f372ba903ac8_image.jpg");
await utapi.deleteFiles([
  "2e0fdb64-9957-4262-8e45-f372ba903ac8_image.jpg",
  "1649353b-04ea-48a2-9db7-31de7f562c8d_image2.jpg",
]);
```

| Arguments | Type                 | Required | Description                                |
| :-------- | :------------------- | :------- | :----------------------------------------- |
| input     | string \|\| string[] | Yes      | The fileKey or fileKeys you want to delete |

### `getFileUrls`

`getFileUrls` takes in a fileKey or an array of fileKeys and returns the URLs to
access them.

```ts
import { utapi } from "uploadthing/server";

const oneUrl = await utapi.getFileUrls(
  "2e0fdb64-9957-4262-8e45-f372ba903ac8_image.jpg",
);
const multipleUrls = await utapi.getFileUrls([
  "2e0fdb64-9957-4262-8e45-f372ba903ac8_image.jpg",
  "1649353b-04ea-48a2-9db7-31de7f562c8d_image2.jpg",
]);
```

| Arguments | Type                 | Required | Description                                      |
| :-------- | :------------------- | :------- | :----------------------------------------------- |
| input     | string \|\| string[] | Yes      | The fileKey or fileKeys you want to get URLs for |
