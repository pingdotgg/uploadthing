## createUploadthing

The helper function to create an UploadThing instance. MAKE SURE YOU IMPORT IT
FROM THE RIGHT PLACE. The export name ensures your file routes' `middleware`
functions are typed correctly.

## File Routes

File Routes are the routes you create with the helper instantiated by
`createUploadthing`. Think of them as the "endpoints" for what your users can
upload. The keys in the object are the names of your endpoints.

```ts
import { createUploadthing, type FileRouter } from "uploadthing/next";

const f = createUploadthing();

export const ourFileRouter = {
  // Example "profile picture upload" route - these can be named whatever you want!
  profilePicture: f(["image"])
    .middleware(({ req }) => auth(req))
    .onUploadComplete((data) => console.log("file", data)),

  // This route takes an attached image OR video
  messageAttachment: f(["image", "video"])
    .middleware(({ req }) => auth(req))
    .onUploadComplete((data) => console.log("file", data)),

  // Takes exactly ONE image up to 2MB
  strictImageAttachment: f({
    image: { maxFileSize: "2MB", maxFileCount: 1, minFileCount: 1 },
  })
    .middleware(({ req }) => auth(req))
    .onUploadComplete((data) => console.log("file", data)),

  // Takes up to 4 2mb images and/or 1 256mb video
  mediaPost: f({
    image: { maxFileSize: "2MB", maxFileCount: 4 },
    video: { maxFileSize: "256MB", maxFileCount: 1 },
  })
    .middleware(({ req }) => auth(req))
    .onUploadComplete((data) => console.log("file", data)),
} satisfies FileRouter;

export type OurFileRouter = typeof ourFileRouter;
```

### Route Config

```ts
// Your file types can be any of the following types
type MimeType = /** any web mime-type */
type ValidFileTypes = "image" | "video" | "audio" | "blob" | "pdf" | "text" | MimeType;
type ContentDisposition = "inline" | "attachment";
type ACL = "public-read" | "private";

// The input to your f() function can be an array of file types OR an object of them w/ config
type FileRouterInput =
  | ValidFileTypes[]
  | {
      [key: ValidFileTypes]: {
        maxFileSize?: string;
        maxFileCount?: number;
        minFileCount?: number;
        contentDisposition?: ContentDisposition = "inline";
        acl?: ACL;
      };
    };
```

MIME types can also be used as keys in the FileRouter. For example: use
`application/json` to only allow JSON files to be uploaded. You can read more
about MIME types on
[MDN ↗](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_Types).

The `contentDisposition` option can be used to override the default `inline`
disposition set at the storage provider. This is useful if you want your files
downloaded instead of previewed in the browser. You can read more about content
disposition on
[MDN ↗](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Disposition).

<Callout>
  ACL can only be overridden if you have enabled the "Allow Overriding ACL"
  setting on the UploadThing dashboard. Attempts to override the ACL without
  enabling this setting will result in an error.
</Callout>

#### Defaults

All routes default to a max file count of 1. The file size defaults are below

| File Type | Default Max Size |
| :-------- | :--------------- |
| image     | 4MB              |
| video     | 16MB             |
| audio     | 8MB              |
| blob      | 8MB              |
| pdf       | 4MB              |
| text      | 64kB             |
| MimeType  | 4MB              |

### `input`

You can pass a `zod` schema to validate user input from the client. This data
comes from the client when the upload starts. If validation here fails, an error
will be thrown and none of your `middleware` n'or `onUploadComplete` functions
will be executed.

The input is validated on **your** server and only leaves your server if you
pass it along from the `.middleware` to the `.onUploadComplete`. If you only use
the input in the middleware without returning it, the Uploadthing server won't
have any knowledge of it.

<Callout type="info">
  If you want to disable FE components based on when your `input` is not
  satisfied, you can place your validator in a shared file, so that you can
  import it in both the server-side `.input()` and on the client-side for your
  `disabled` prop logic.
</Callout>

```ts
import { z } from "zod";

f(["image"])
  .input(z.object({ foo: z.string() }))
  .middleware(async ({ req, input }) => {
    input;
    // ^? { foo: string }
    return {};
  })
  .onUploadComplete(async () => {});
```

### `middleware`

This is the function where you authorize a user to do an upload. You can also
tag the upload with metadata here. Example using Clerk:

```ts
import { currentUser } from "@clerk/nextjs";

import { UploadThingError } from "uploadthing/server";

f(["image"])
  .middleware(async ({ req, res }) => {
    const user = await currentUser();

    // Throw if user isn't signed in
    if (!user)
      throw new UploadThingError(
        "You must be logged in to upload a profile picture",
      );

    // Return userId to be used in onUploadComplete
    return { userId: user.id };
  })
  .onUploadComplete(async ({ metadata }) => {
    console.log("Uploaded by user", metadata.userId);
  });
```

<Callout type="info">
  Note: By default, a thrown `UploadThingError`'s message will be sent to the
  client's `onError`. All other errors are turned into generic failure messages
  to avoid leaking sensitive information.
</Callout>

As of `v6.4`, you can also tag your metadata using the `UTFiles` symbol to
override the uploaded files attributes. This can be used to either rename the
file, or set a custom identifer for the file:

```ts
import { UTFiles } from "uploadthing/server";

f(["image"])
  .middleware(async ({ req, files }) => {
    const fileOverrides = files.map((file) => {
      const newName = sluggify(file.name);
      const myIdentifier = generateId();
      return { ...file, name: newName, customId: myIdentifier };
    });

    // Return userId to be used in onUploadComplete
    return { foo: "bar" as const, [UTFiles]: fileOverrides };
  })
  .onUploadComplete(async ({ metadata, file }) => {
    // The UTFIles symbol is stripped from the metadata
    metadata; // { foo: "bar" }
    file.customId; // myIdentifier
  });
```

### `onUploadComplete`

This is the function you use to do something with the uploaded file, such as
persisting it to your database. Whatever you returned in the middleware will be
accessible here.

As of v6.0, you can return JSON serializable data from this function, which will
be passed to the clientside `onClientUploadComplete` callback.

## `createRouteHandler`

All adapters exports a `createRouteHandler` function that exposes your router to
the world. By default, you should only have to pass your router to this
function, although there are some extra configuration options available.

> The names of the exported `createRouteHandler` is different prior to `v6.3`.
