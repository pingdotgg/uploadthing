# Getting Started With `pages/`

<Callout type="warning">
  If you're using the `pages/` directory in Next still, you HAVE TO DISABLE THE `esmExternals` FLAG:

```ts
// next.config.js
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  experimental: {
    esmExternals: false, // THIS IS THE FLAG THAT MATTERS
  },
};

module.exports = nextConfig;
```

## Set Up A FileRouter

<Steps>
### Creating your first FileRoute

All files uploaded to uploadthing are associated with a FileRoute. Think of a FileRoute similar to an endpoint, it has:

- Permitted types ["image", "video", etc]
- Max file size
- (Optional) `middleware` to authenticate and tag requests
- `onUploadComplete` callback for when uploads are completed

```ts copy
/** server/uploadthing.ts */
import { createUploadthing, type FileRouter } from "uploadthing/next-legacy";
const f = createUploadthing();

const auth = (req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) => ({ id: "fakeId" }); // Fake auth function

// FileRouter for your app, can contain multiple FileRoutes
export const ourFileRouter = {
  // Define as many FileRoutes as you like, each with a unique routeSlug
  imageUploader: f
    // Set permissions and file types for this FileRoute
    .fileTypes(["image", "video"])
    .maxSize("1GB")
    .middleware(async (req, res) => {
      // This code runs on your server before upload
      const user = await auth(req, res);

      // If you throw, the user will not be able to upload
      if (!user) throw new Error("Unauthorized");

      // Whatever is returned here is accessible in onUploadComplete as `metadata`
      return { userId: user.id };
    })
    .onUploadComplete(async ({ metadata, file }) => {
      // This code RUNS ON YOUR SERVER after upload
      console.log("Upload complete for userId:", metadata.userId);

      console.log("file url", file.url);
    }),
} satisfies FileRouter;

export type OurFileRouter = typeof ourFileRouter;
```

### Create a Next.js API route using the FileRouter

<Callout type="warning">
  Note: This is the ONLY FILE WHERE THE PATH MATTERS. You need to serve this API
  from `pages/api/uploadthing` on your application.
</Callout>

```ts copy
/** pages/api/uploadthing.ts */
import { createNextPageApiHandler } from "uploadthing/next-legacy";
import { ourFileRouter } from "~/server/uploadthing";

const handler = createNextPageApiHandler({
  router: ourFileRouter,
});

export default handler;
```

### Use the FileRouter in your app

The `@uploadthing/react` package includes an "UploadButton" component that you can simply drop into your app, and start uploading files immediately.

```ts copy
import { UploadButton } from "@uploadthing/react";

import type { OurFileRouter } from "~/server/uploadthing";
  
// You need to import our styles for the button to look right. Best to import in the root /_app.tsx but this is fine
import "@uploadthing/react/styles.css";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main className="flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center justify-between p-24">
      <UploadButton<OurFileRouter>
        endpoint="imageUploader"
        onClientUploadComplete={() => {
          alert("Upload Completed");
        }}
        onUploadError={(error: Error) => {
          // Do something with the error.
          alert(`ERROR! ${error.message}`);
        }}
      />
    </main>
  );
}
```

</Steps>
