# Astro Setup

You can use Astro with any of the frontend frameworks we support. This guide
will walk you through setting it up using React, but the steps will be near
identical for other frameworks too.

## Set Up A FileRouter

<Steps>
### Creating your first FileRoute

All files uploaded to uploadthing are associated with a FileRoute. Think of a
FileRoute similar to an endpoint, it has:

- Permitted types ["image", "video", etc]
- Max file size
- (Optional) `middleware` to authenticate and tag requests
- `onUploadComplete` callback for when uploads are completed

```ts copy filename="src/server/uploadthing.ts"
import { createUploadthing, type FileRouter } from "uploadthing/server";

const f = createUploadthing();

const auth = (req: Request) => ({ id: "fakeId" }); // Fake auth function

// FileRouter for your app, can contain multiple FileRoutes
export const ourFileRouter = {
  // Define as many FileRoutes as you like, each with a unique routeSlug
  imageUploader: f({ image: { maxFileSize: "4MB" } })
    // Set permissions and file types for this FileRoute
    .middleware(async ({ req }) => {
      // This code runs on your server before upload
      const user = await auth(req);

      // If you throw, the user will not be able to upload
      if (!user) throw new Error("Unauthorized");

      // Whatever is returned here is accessible in onUploadComplete as `metadata`
      return { userId: user.id };
    })
    .onUploadComplete(async ({ metadata, file }) => {
      // This code RUNS ON YOUR SERVER after upload
      console.log("Upload complete for userId:", metadata.userId);

      console.log("file url", file.url);

      // !!! Whatever is returned here is sent to the clientside `onClientUploadComplete` callback
      return { uploadedBy: metadata.userId };
    }),
} satisfies FileRouter;

export type OurFileRouter = typeof ourFileRouter;
```

### Create a Astro API route using the FileRouter

<Callout type="info">
  File path here doesn't matter, you can serve this from any route. We recommend
  serving it from `/api/uploadthing`.
</Callout>

```ts copy filename="src/pages/api/uploadthing.ts"
import { createRouteHandler } from "uploadthing/server";

import { ourFileRouter } from "~/server/uploadthing";

// Export routes for Next App Router
export const { GET, POST } = createRouteHandler({
  router: ourFileRouter,
  config: {
    uploadthingSecret: import.meta.env.UPLOADTHING_SECRET,
  },
});
```

> See configuration options in
> [server API reference](/api-reference/server#createroutehandler)

### Add UploadThing's Styles

<Tabs items={["Tailwind", "Not Tailwind"]}>
  <Tab>
    <TailwindSetup />
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    Include our CSS file in the root layout to make sure the components look right!

    ```astro copy filename="src/layouts/root.astro"
    ---
    import "@uploadthing/react/styles.css";
    // ...
    ---
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Create The UploadThing Components (Recommended)

We provide components to make uploading easier. We **highly recommend
re-exporting them with the types assigned**, but you CAN import the components
individually from `@uploadthing/react` instead.

```ts copy filename="src/utils/uploadthing.ts"
import {
  generateUploadButton,
  generateUploadDropzone,
} from "@uploadthing/react";

import type { OurFileRouter } from "~/server/uploadthing";

export const UploadButton = generateUploadButton<OurFileRouter>();
export const UploadDropzone = generateUploadDropzone<OurFileRouter>();
```

### Mount A Button And Upload!

<Callout type="info">
  Don't forget to add the `"use client;"` directive at the top of your file,
  since the `UploadButton` component needs to run on the client-side.
</Callout>

```tsx copy filename="src/components/image-uploader.tsx"
import { UploadButton } from "~/utils/uploadthing";

export function ImageUploader() {
  return (
    <UploadButton
      endpoint="imageUploader"
      onClientUploadComplete={(res) => {
        // Do something with the response
        console.log("Files: ", res);
        alert("Upload Completed");
      }}
      onUploadError={(error: Error) => {
        // Do something with the error.
        alert(`ERROR! ${error.message}`);
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

```astro copy filename="src/pages/index.astro"
---
import Layout from "~/layouts/root.astro"
import { ImageUploader } from "~/components/image-uploader";
---
<Layout>
    <ImageUploader client:load />
</Layout>
```

### (Optional) Rendering with SSR

import { WithoutSSR, WithSSR } from "../../components/ssr-diff";

<div className="mt-6 flex items-center justify-center gap-8">
  <WithoutSSR />
  <WithSSR />
</div>

UploadThing needs to get info from your server to get permissions info. Normally
this means a loading state, but you can inject the router config from
server-rendered Astro components:

```astro copy filename="src/components/uploadthing-ssr.astro"
---
import { extractRouterConfig } from "uploadthing/server"
import { uploadRouter } from "~/server/uploadthing";

/**
 * This you only need to do once in your app to enable
 * server side rendering of the uploadthing component.
 * No data will be fetched on the client.
 */
const routerConfig = extractRouterConfig(uploadRouter);
(globalThis as any).__UPLOADTHING ??= routerConfig;
---

<script define:vars={{ routerConfig }}>
    /**
     * Injecting config to the client. This prevents the client from fetching
     * the configuration from the server, since we already have it.
     */
    globalThis.__UPLOADTHING ??= routerConfig;
</script>
```

Then render this component in your layout:

```astro copy filename="src/layouts/root.astro"
---
import UploadThingSSR from "~/components/uploadthing-ssr.astro";
---
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <title>My App</title>
    </head>
        <UploadThingSSR />
    <body>
        <slot />
    </body>
</html>
```

</Steps>

---
