# Next.js App Router Setup

Oh, a little bleeding edge are we? We're big fans of `app/` and server
components, and we think you'll love what we've built üôè

<EnvSetup />

## Set Up A FileRouter

<Steps>
### Creating your first FileRoute

All files uploaded to uploadthing are associated with a FileRoute. Think of a
FileRoute similar to an endpoint, it has:

- Permitted types ["image", "video", etc]
- Max file size
- (Optional) `middleware` to authenticate and tag requests
- `onUploadComplete` callback for when uploads are completed

```ts copy filename="app/api/uploadthing/core.ts"
import { createUploadthing, type FileRouter } from "uploadthing/next";

const f = createUploadthing();

const auth = (req: Request) => ({ id: "fakeId" }); // Fake auth function

// FileRouter for your app, can contain multiple FileRoutes
export const ourFileRouter = {
  // Define as many FileRoutes as you like, each with a unique routeSlug
  imageUploader: f({ image: { maxFileSize: "4MB" } })
    // Set permissions and file types for this FileRoute
    .middleware(async ({ req }) => {
      // This code runs on your server before upload
      const user = await auth(req);

      // If you throw, the user will not be able to upload
      if (!user) throw new Error("Unauthorized");

      // Whatever is returned here is accessible in onUploadComplete as `metadata`
      return { userId: user.id };
    })
    .onUploadComplete(async ({ metadata, file }) => {
      // This code RUNS ON YOUR SERVER after upload
      console.log("Upload complete for userId:", metadata.userId);

      console.log("file url", file.url);
    }),
} satisfies FileRouter;

export type OurFileRouter = typeof ourFileRouter;
```

### Create a Next.js API route using the FileRouter

<Callout type="info">
  File path here doesn't matter, you can serve this from any route. We recommend
  serving it from `/api/uploadthing`.
</Callout>

```ts copy filename="app/api/uploadthing/route.ts"
import { createNextRouteHandler } from "uploadthing/next";

import { ourFileRouter } from "./core";

// Export routes for Next App Router
export const { GET, POST } = createNextRouteHandler({
  router: ourFileRouter,
});
```

### Add UploadThing's Styles

<Tabs items={["Tailwind", "Not Tailwind"]}>
  <Tab>
    <TailwindSetup />
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    Include our CSS file in the root layout to make sure the components look right!

    ```tsx copy filename="app/layout.tsx"
    import "@uploadthing/react/styles.css";
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Create The UploadThing Components (Recommended)

We provide components to make uploading easier. We **highly recommend
re-exporting them with the types assigned**, but you CAN import the components
individually from `@uploadthing/react` instead.

```ts copy filename="src/utils/uploadthing.ts"
import { generateComponents } from "@uploadthing/react";

import type { OurFileRouter } from "~/app/api/uploadthing/core";

export const { UploadButton, UploadDropzone, Uploader } =
  generateComponents<OurFileRouter>();
```

### Mount A Button And Upload!

```tsx copy filename="app/example-uploader/page.tsx"
"use client";

import { UploadButton } from "~/utils/uploadthing";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main className="flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center justify-between p-24">
      <UploadButton
        endpoint="imageUploader"
        onClientUploadComplete={(res) => {
          // Do something with the response
          console.log("Files: ", res);
          alert("Upload Completed");
        }}
        onUploadError={(error: Error) => {
          // Do something with the error.
          alert(`ERROR! ${error.message}`);
        }}
      />
    </main>
  );
}
```

### (Optional) UploadThing SSR Plugin

UploadThing needs to get info from your server to get permissions info. Normally
this means a loading state. We built an optional plugin to prevent that

import { WithoutSSR, WithSSR } from "../../components/ssr-diff";

<div className="mt-6 flex items-center justify-center gap-8">
  <WithoutSSR />
  <WithSSR />
</div>

To add SSR hydration and avoid that loading state, simply render the
`<NextSSRPlugin />` hydration helper in the body of your root layout **before**
the children.

```tsx copy filename="app/layout.tsx"
import { NextSSRPlugin } from "@uploadthing/react/next-ssr-plugin";
import { extractRouterConfig } from "uploadthing/server";

import { ourFileRouter } from "~/app/api/uploadthing/core";

export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <NextSSRPlugin
          /**
           * The `extractRouterConfig` will extract **only** the route configs
           * from the router to prevent additional information from being
           * leaked to the client. The data passed to the client is the same
           * as if you were to fetch `/api/uploadthing` directly.
           */
          routerConfig={extractRouterConfig(ourFileRouter)}
        />
        {children}
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

</Steps>
