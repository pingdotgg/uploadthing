# Getting Started using Nuxt

The UploadThing Nuxt module makes it super easy to get started with uploading in
Nuxt apps. It is a wrapper around `@uploadthing/vue` and the H3 backend adapter.

<Callout type="info">
  Check out a full example
  [here](https://github.com/pingdotgg/uploadthing/tree/Mr0Bread/nuxt-support/examples/minimal-nuxt)
</Callout>

  Using standalone Vue without Nuxt? Checkout the standalone example
  [here](https://github.com/pingdotgg/uploadthing/tree/Mr0Bread/nuxt-support/examples/backend-adapters/client-vue)
</Callout>

## Package Setup

<Steps>

### Install the packages

```bash copy npm2yarn
npm install uploadthing @uploadthing/nuxt
```

### Add env variables

```bash
NUXT_UPLOADTHING_SECRET=... # A secret key for your app (starts with sk_live_)
# 🖕 NUXT_ prefix is **important**
```

<Callout type="warning">
  If you don't already have a uploadthing secret key, [sign
  up](https://uploadthing.com/sign-in) and create one from the
  [dashboard!](https://uploadthing.com/dashboard)
</Callout>

</Steps>

## Initialize the Uploadthing module

Add the `@uploadthing/nuxt` module to your `nuxt.config.js` file:

```ts copy filename="nuxt.config.js"
export default {
  modules: ["@uploadthing/nuxt"],
  uploadthing: {
    /**
     * Path to your router definition file
     * @default `~/server/uploadthing.ts`
     */
    routerPath: "",
  },
};
```

You can set some module options in the `uploadthing` property of your
`nuxt.config.js` file:

```ts
/**
 * See https://docs.uploadthing.com/api-reference/server#createroutehandler
 * for more information about the `RouteHandlerConfig` options.
 */
export type ModuleOptions = Omit<
  RouteHandlerConfig,
  "uploadthingSecret" | "uploadthingId"
> & {
  /**
   * Path to your router definition file
   * @default `~/server/uploadthing.ts`
   */
  routerPath?: string;
  /**
   * Your UploadThing secret key
   * @default `process.env.NUXT_UPLOADTHING_SECRET`
   */
  secret?: string;
  /**
   * Your UploadThing app ID
   * @default `process.env.NUXT_UPLOADTHING_APP_ID`
   */
  appId?: string;
};
```

## Set Up A FileRouter

All files uploaded to uploadthing are associated with a FileRoute. The following
is a very minimalistic example, with a single FileRoute "imageUploader". Think
of a FileRoute similar to an endpoint, it has:

- Permitted types ["image", "video", etc]
- Max file size
- (Optional) `middleware` to authenticate and tag requests
- `onUploadComplete` callback for when uploads are completed

To get full insight into what you can do with the FileRoutes, please refer to
the [File Router API](/api-reference/server#file-routes).

<Callout type="info">
  It is import you export the router as `uploadRouter` and the inferred type as
  `UploadRouter` for the module to pick up your router and it's types.
</Callout>

```ts copy filename="src/lib/server/uploadthing.ts"
import type { H3Event } from "h3";

import { createUploadthing } from "uploadthing/h3";
import type { FileRouter } from "uploadthing/h3";

const f = createUploadthing();

const auth = (ev: H3Event) => ({ id: "fakeId" }); // Fake auth function

// FileRouter for your app, can contain multiple FileRoutes
export const uploadRouter = {
  // Define as many FileRoutes as you like, each with a unique routeSlug
  imageUploader: f({ image: { maxFileSize: "4MB" } })
    // Set permissions and file types for this FileRoute
    .middleware(async ({ event }) => {
      // This code runs on your server before upload
      const user = await auth(event);

      // If you throw, the user will not be able to upload
      if (!user) throw new Error("Unauthorized");

      // Whatever is returned here is accessible in onUploadComplete as `metadata`
      return { userId: user.id };
    })
    .onUploadComplete(async ({ metadata, file }) => {
      // This code RUNS ON YOUR SERVER after upload
      console.log("Upload complete for userId:", metadata.userId);

      console.log("file url", file.url);
    }),
} satisfies FileRouter;

export type UploadRouter = typeof uploadRouter;
```

### Upload some files!

Just mount one of our components in your app and start uploading files!

```vue copy filename="pages/index.vue"
<script setup lang="ts">
const alert = (msg: string) => {
  window.alert(msg);
};
</script>

<template>
  <div>
    <UploadButton
      :config="{
        endpoint: 'imageUploader',
        onClientUploadComplete: (file) => {
          console.log('uploaded', file);
          alert('Upload complete');
        },
        onUploadError: (error) => {
          console.error(error, error.cause);
          alert('Upload failed');
        },
      }"
    />
    <UploadDropzone
      :config="{
        endpoint: 'imageUploader',
        onClientUploadComplete: (file) => {
          console.log('uploaded', file);
          alert('Upload complete');
        },
        onUploadError: (error) => {
          console.error(error, error.cause);
          alert('Upload failed');
        },
      }"
    />
  </div>
</template>
```

<Callout type="info">
  For component API reference, refer to [the React API
  reference](/api-reference/react). Framework specific docs will be added soon.
</Callout>

### Custom flows with the `useUploadThing` composable

If the premade components don't fit your needs, you can use the `useUploadThing`
to create your own custom components.

```vue copy filename="pages/index.vue"
<script setup lang="ts">
const alert = (msg: string) => {
  window.alert(msg);
};

const { startUpload } = useUploadThing("videoAndImage", {
  onClientUploadComplete(res) {
    console.log(`onClientUploadComplete`, res);
    alert("Upload Completed");
  },
});
</script>

<template>
  <label>
    <input
      type="file"
      @change="
        async (e) => {
          console.log(`e`, e);
          const file = (e.target as HTMLInputElement).files?.[0];
          if (!file) return;

          // Do something with files

          // Then start the upload
          await startUpload([file]);
        }
      "
    />
  </label>
</template>
```
