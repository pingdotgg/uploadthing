# Expo Setup

UploadThing is the easiest way to add file uploads to your native mobile
applications powered by export.

<Callout type="info">
  Check out a full example
  [here](https://github.com/pingdotgg/uploadthing/tree/main/examples/minimal-expo)
</Callout>

## Package Setup

<Steps>

### Install the packages

```bash copy npm2yarn
npm install uploadthing @uploadthing/expo expo-image-picker expo-document-picker
```

### Add env variables

<Callout>
  If you don't already have a uploadthing secret key, [sign
  up](https://uploadthing.com/sign-in) and create one from the
  [dashboard!](https://uploadthing.com/dashboard)
</Callout>

```bash copy
UPLOADTHING_SECRET=... # A secret key for your app (starts with sk_live_)
UPLOADTHING_APP_ID=... # Your app id
EXPO_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL=... # Absolute URL to your server
```

</Steps>

## Set Up A FileRouter

<Callout type="info">
  Steps 1 and 2 below assumes you're using [Expo API
  routes](https://docs.expo.dev/router/reference/api-routes/) which are
  currently experimental. You can also choose to use a standalone server using
  some of our [backend adapters, e.g. Fetch](/backend-adapters/fetch)
</Callout>

<Steps>
### Creating your first FileRoute

<Callout>
  For more details on how to create a file router, see the
  [router](/api-reference/server#file-routes) docs
</Callout>

All files uploaded to uploadthing are associated with a FileRoute. The following
is a very minimalistic example, with a single FileRoute "imageUploader". Think
of a FileRoute similar to an endpoint, it has:

- Permitted types ["image", "video", etc]
- Max file size
- (Optional) `middleware` to authenticate and tag requests
- `onUploadComplete` callback for when uploads are completed

To get full insight into what you can do with the FileRoutes, please refer to
the [File Router API](/api-reference/server#file-routes).

```ts copy filename="src/app/api/uploadthing+api.ts"
import { createUploadthing, UploadThingError } from "uploadthing/server";
import type { FileRouter } from "uploadthing/server";

const f = createUploadthing();

const auth = (req: Request) => ({ id: "fakeId" }); // Fake auth function

const uploadRouter = {
  profileImage: f({
    image: {
      maxFileSize: "4MB",
    },
  })
    .middleware(async ({ req }) => {
      // This code runs on your server before upload
      const user = await auth(req);

      // If you throw, the user will not be able to upload
      if (!user) throw new UploadThingError("Unauthorized");

      // Whatever is returned here is accessible in onUploadComplete as `metadata`
      return { userId: user.id };
    })
    .onUploadComplete(({ file, metadata }) => {
      // This code RUNS ON YOUR SERVER after upload
      console.log("Upload complete for userId:", metadata.userId);

      console.log("file url", file.url);

      // !!! Whatever is returned here is sent to the clientside `onClientUploadComplete` callback
      return { uploadedBy: metadata.userId };
    }),
} satisfies FileRouter;
export type UploadRouter = typeof uploadRouter;
```

### Create an API route using the FileRouter

```ts copy filename="src/app/api/uploadthing+api.ts"
import { createRouteHandler } from "uploadthing/server";

const uploadRouter = { ... } satisfies FileRouter;
export type UploadRouter = typeof uploadRouter;

export const { GET, POST } = createRouteHandler({
  router: uploadRouter,

  // Apply an (optional) custom config:
  // config: { ... },
});
```

> See configuration options in
> [server API reference](/api-reference/server#createroutehandler)

### Generate typed hooks

Unlike the other UploadThing packages, the Expo package does not include any
prebuilt components. Instead, we provide some helper hooks to help interact with
the native file pickers.

```tsx copy filename="src/utils/uploadthing.ts"
import { generateReactNativeHelpers } from "@uploadthing/expo";

import type { UploadRouter } from "~/app/api/uploadthing+api";

export const { useImageUploader, useDocumentUploader } =
  generateReactNativeHelpers<UploadRouter>({
    /**
     * Your server url.
     * @default process.env.EXPO_PUBLIC_SERVER_URL
     * @remarks In dev we will also try to use Expo.debuggerHost
     */
    url: "https://my-server.com",
  });
```

### Use the FileRouter in your app

```tsx copy filename="src/routes/index.tsx"
import { openSettings } from "expo-linking";
import { Alert, Pressable, StyleSheet, Text, View } from "react-native";

import { useImageUploader } from "~/utils/uploadthing";

export default function Home() {
  const { openImagePicker, isUploading } = useImageUploader({
    /**
     * Any props here are forwarded to the underlying `useUploadThing` hook.
     * Refer to the React API reference for more info.
     */
    onClientUploadComplete: () => Alert.alert("Upload Completed"),
    onUploadError: (error) => Alert.alert("Upload Error", error.message),
  });

  return (
    <View>
      <Pressable
        style={styles.button}
        onPress={() => {
          openImagePicker({
            input, // Matches the input schema from the FileRouter endpoint
            source: "library", // or "camera"
            onInsufficientPermissions: () => {
              Alert.alert(
                "No Permissions",
                "You need to grant permission to your Photos to use this",
                [
                  { text: "Dismiss" },
                  { text: "Open Settings", onPress: openSettings },
                ],
              );
            },
          })
        }}
      >
        <Text>Select Image</Text>
      </Pressable>
    </View>
  );
}

const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  button: { ... },
});
```

</Steps>
