# Next.js (Legacy) Page Router Setup

No shame in using Page Router still! We still use it for a lot of things at Ping
ðŸ˜Š. If your code is still mostly served from the `pages/` directory, this is
where you want to be

<EnvSetup />

## Set Up A FileRouter

<Steps>
### Creating your first FileRoute

All files uploaded to uploadthing are associated with a FileRoute. Think of a
FileRoute similar to an endpoint, it has:

- Permitted types ["image", "video", etc]
- Max file size
- (Optional) `middleware` to authenticate and tag requests
- `onUploadComplete` callback for when uploads are completed

```tsx copy filename="server/uploadthing.ts"
import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from "next";

import { createUploadthing, type FileRouter } from "uploadthing/next-legacy";
import { UploadThingError } from "uploadthing/server";

const f = createUploadthing();

const auth = (req: NextApiRequest, res: NextApiResponse) => ({ id: "fakeId" }); // Fake auth function

// FileRouter for your app, can contain multiple FileRoutes
export const ourFileRouter = {
  // Define as many FileRoutes as you like, each with a unique routeSlug
  imageUploader: f({ image: { maxFileSize: "4MB" } })
    // Set permissions and file types for this FileRoute
    .middleware(async ({ req, res }) => {
      // This code runs on your server before upload
      const user = await auth(req, res);

      // If you throw, the user will not be able to upload
      if (!user) throw new UploadThingError("Unauthorized");

      // Whatever is returned here is accessible in onUploadComplete as `metadata`
      return { userId: user.id };
    })
    .onUploadComplete(async ({ metadata, file }) => {
      // This code RUNS ON YOUR SERVER after upload
      console.log("Upload complete for userId:", metadata.userId);

      console.log("file url", file.url);

      // !!! Whatever is returned here is sent to the clientside `onClientUploadComplete` callback
      return { uploadedBy: metadata.userId };
    }),
} satisfies FileRouter;

export type OurFileRouter = typeof ourFileRouter;
```

### Create a Next.js API route using the FileRouter

<Callout type="info">
  File path here doesn't matter, you can serve this from any route. We recommend
  serving it from `/api/uploadthing`.
</Callout>

```ts copy filename="pages/api/uploadthing.ts"
import { createRouteHandler } from "uploadthing/next-legacy";

import { ourFileRouter } from "~/server/uploadthing";

export default createRouteHandler({
  router: ourFileRouter,
  config: { ... },
});
```

> See configuration options in
> [server API reference](/api-reference/server#createroutehandler)

### Add UploadThing's Styles

<Tabs items={["Tailwind", "Not Tailwind"]}>
  <Tab>
    <TailwindSetup />
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    Include our CSS file in the root layout to make sure the components look right!

    ```tsx copy filename="_app.tsx"
    import "@uploadthing/react/styles.css";
    ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Create The UploadThing Components (Recommended)

```ts copy filename="src/utils/uploadthing.ts"
import {
  generateUploadButton,
  generateUploadDropzone,
} from "@uploadthing/react";

import type { OurFileRouter } from "~/server/uploadthing";

export const UploadButton = generateUploadButton<OurFileRouter>();
export const UploadDropzone = generateUploadDropzone<OurFileRouter>();
```

### Mount A Button And Upload!

The `@uploadthing/react` package includes an "UploadButton" component that you
can simply drop into your app, and start uploading files immediately.

```tsx copy filename="app/example-uploader.tsx"
import { UploadButton } from "~/utils/uploadthing";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main className="flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center justify-between p-24">
      <UploadButton
        endpoint="imageUploader"
        onClientUploadComplete={(res) => {
          // Do something with the response
          console.log("Files: ", res);
          alert("Upload Completed");
        }}
        onUploadError={(error: Error) => {
          // Do something with the error.
          alert(`ERROR! ${error.message}`);
        }}
      />
    </main>
  );
}
```

</Steps>
