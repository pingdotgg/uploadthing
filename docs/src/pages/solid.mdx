import { Callout, Steps } from "nextra-theme-docs";

## Package Setup

<Steps>

### Install the packages

```bash copy npm2yarn
npm install uploadthing @uploadthing/solid solidjs-dropzone attr-accept
```

### Add env variables

<Callout>
  If you don't already have a uploadthing secret key, [sign
  up](https://uploadthing.com/sign-in) and create one from the
  [dashboard!](https://uploadthing.com/dashboard)
</Callout>

```bash copy
UPLOADTHING_SECRET=... # A secret key for your app (starts with sk_live_)
UPLOADTHING_APP_ID=... # Your app id
```

</Steps>

## Set Up A FileRouter

<Steps>
### Creating your first FileRoute

<Callout>
  For more details on how to create a file router, see the
  [router](/api-reference/server#file-routes) docs
</Callout>

All files uploaded to uploadthing are associated with a FileRoute. Think of a
FileRoute similar to an endpoint, it has:

- Permitted types ["image", "video", etc]
- Max file size
- (Optional) `middleware` to authenticate and tag requests
- `onUploadComplete` callback for when uploads are completed

```ts copy filename="src/server/uploadthing.ts"
import { createUploadthing } from "uploadthing/server";
import type { FileRouter } from "uploadthing/server";

const f = createUploadthing();

export const uploadRouter = {
  profileImage: f({
    image: {
      maxFileSize: "4MB",
    },
  })
    .middleware(({ req }) => {
      // Check some condition based on the incoming requrest
      if (!req.headers.get("x-some-header")) {
        throw new Error("x-some-header is required");
      }

      // Return some metadata to be stored with the file
      return { foo: "bar" as const };
    })
    .onUploadComplete(({ file, metadata }) => {
      metadata;
      // ^?
      console.log("upload completed", file);
    }),
} satisfies FileRouter;

export type OurFileRouter = typeof uploadRouter;
```

### Create an API route using the FileRouter

<Callout>
  File path here doesn't matter, you can serve this from any route. We recommend
  serving it from `/api/uploadthing`.
</Callout>

```ts copy filename="src/routes/api/uploadthing.ts"
import { createServerHandler } from "uploadthing/server";

import { uploadRouter } from "~/server/uploadthing";

export const { GET, POST } = createServerHandler({
  router: uploadRouter,
});
```

### Creating The UploadThing Components (recommended)

Generating components lets you pass your generic `FileRouter` and `url` once and
then have typesafe components everywhere, instead of having to pass the generic
and url everytime you mount a component, but you can also import the components
individually from `@uploadthing/react`.

```ts copy filename="src/utils/uploadthing.ts"
import { generateComponents } from "@uploadthing/solid";

import type { OurFileRouter } from "~/server/uploadthing";
import { getBaseUrl } from "~/utils/getBaseUrl";

export const { UploadButton, UploadDropzone, Uploader } =
  generateComponents<OurFileRouter>({
    url: getBaseUrl() + "/api/uploadthing",
  });
```

### Include our stylesheet

You need to import our styles for the button to look right. Import this in the
`root.tsx` makes it available everywhere.

```tsx copy filename="src/root.tsx"
import "@uploadthing/solid/styles.css";

export default function Root() {
  ...
}
```

### Use the FileRouter in your app

The `@uploadthing/solid` package includes an "Uploader" component that you can
simply drop into your app, and start uploading files immediately.

```tsx copy filename="src/routes/index.tsx"
import { Uploader } from "~/utils/uploadthing";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main>
      <Uploader
        endpoint="profileImage"
        onClientUploadComplete={(res) => {
          console.log(`onClientUploadComplete`, res);
          alert("Upload Completed");
        }}
        buttonMultiple
      />
    </main>
  );
}
```

</Steps>

### Use the FileRouter in your app

UploadThing provides a few premade components that you can use to upload files
in your app. For component customization, see [Theming](/theming), and for even
more advanced use cases check out the
[hook usage](#advanced-usage-useuploadthing)

#### UploadButton

A simple button that opens the native file picker when clicked. It lists what
files are allowed and how many files can be uploaded of that type.

{/* using React package since Nextra can't mount Solid components, but they look the same */}

import { UploadButton } from "@uploadthing/react";

<UploadButton
  __internal_button_disabled
  __internal_state="ready"
  content={{
    allowedContent: "Allowed content",
    button: "Ready",
  }}
/>

```tsx copy
// Or import from your typed, generated components
import { UploadButton } from "@uploadthing/solid";

import type { OurFileRouter } from "~/server/uploadthing";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main>
      <UploadButton<OurFileRouter>
        endpoint="profileImage"
        // needed when server side rendering
        url="http://localhost:3000"
        onClientUploadComplete={() => {
          alert("Upload Completed");
        }}
        onUploadError={(error: Error) => {
          // Do something with the error.
          alert(`ERROR! ${error.message}`);
        }}
      />
    </main>
  );
}
```

#### UploadDropzone

This is a SolidJS dropzone component that you can use to upload files, you can
drag files into it.

import { UploadDropzone } from "@uploadthing/react";

<UploadDropzone
  __internal_state="ready"
  __internal_button_disabled
  __internal_dropzone_disabled
  __internal_show_button
  content={{
    allowedContent: "Allowed content",
    button: "Ready",
  }}
/>

```tsx copy
// Or import from your typed, generated components
import { UploadDropzone } from "@uploadthing/solid";

import type { OurFileRouter } from "~/server/uploadthing";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main>
      <UploadDropzone<OurFileRouter>
        endpoint="profileImage"
        // needed when server side rendering
        url="http://localhost:3000"
        onClientUploadComplete={() => {
          alert("Upload Completed");
        }}
        onUploadError={(error: Error) => {
          // Do something with the error.
          alert(`ERROR! ${error.message}`);
        }}
      />
    </main>
  );
}
```

#### Uploader

A combination of the `UploadButton` and `UploadDropzone` components.

```tsx copy
// Or import from your typed, generated components
import { Uploader } from "@uploadthing/solid";

import type { OurFileRouter } from "~/server/uploadthing";

export default function Home() {
  return (
    <main>
      <Uploader<OurFileRouter>
        endpoint="profileImage"
        // needed when server side rendering
        url="http://localhost:3000"
        onClientUploadComplete={() => {
          alert("Upload Completed");
        }}
      />
    </main>
  );
}
```

## Advanced usage: `useUploadThing`

For advanced use cases, the premade components might not be flexible enough to
suit your needs. In that case, you can use the `useUploadThing` hook to build
your own components with a custom upload flow:

<Steps>

### Create the hook

First, generate a typed hook using the `generateSolidHelpers` function from
`@uploadthing/solid`:

```tsx copy filename="src/utils/uploadthing.ts"
import { generateSolidHelpers } from "@uploadthing/solid";

import type { OurFileRouter } from "~/server/uploadthing";
import { getBaseUrl } from "~/utils/getBaseUrl";

export const { useUploadThing } = generateSolidHelpers<OurFileRouter>({
  url: getBaseUrl() + "/api/uploadthing",
});
```

### Use the hook

Then, use the hook in your component. By using the hook, you have full control
of when and how to upload files.

```tsx copy filename="src/routes/index.tsx"
import { useUploadThing } from "~/utils/uploadthing";

async function compress(file: File) {
  // Run some compression algorithm on the file
  return file;
}

export default function Home() {
  const { startUpload } = useUploadThing("profileImage", {
    onClientUploadComplete: () => {
      alert("Upload Completed");
    },
  });

  return (
    <main>
      <input
        type="file"
        onChange={async (e) => {
          const file = e.target.files?.[0];
          if (!file) return;

          // Do something with the file before uploading
          const compressed = await compress(file);

          // Then start the upload of the compressed file
          await startUpload([compressed]);
        }}
      />
    </main>
  );
}
```

</Steps>
