# Getting Started

## Package Setup

<Steps>

### Install the packages

import { Tab, Tabs } from "nextra-theme-docs";

<Tabs items={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm"]}>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy 
    npm install uploadthing @uploadthing/solid solidjs-dropzone
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy 
    yarn add uploadthing @uploadthing/solid solidjs-dropzone
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy 
    pnpm install uploadthing @uploadthing/solid solidjs-dropzone
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Add env variables

```bash copy
UPLOADTHING_SECRET=... # A secret key for your app (starts with sk_live_)
```

<Callout type="warning">
  If you don't already have a uploadthing secret key, [sign up](/create-account) and create one from
  the [dashboard!](https://uploadthing.com/dashboard)
</Callout>
</Steps>

## Set Up A FileRouter

<Steps>
### Creating your first FileRoute

All files uploaded to uploadthing are associated with a FileRoute. Think of a FileRoute similar to an endpoint, it has:

- Permitted types ["image", "video", etc]
- Max file size
- (Optional) `middleware` to authenticate and tag requests
- `onUploadComplete` callback for when uploads are completed

```ts copy
/** src/api/uploadthing/core.ts */
import { createUploadthing, type FileRouter } from "uploadthing";
const f = createUploadthing();

const auth = (req: Request) => ({ id: "fakeId" }); // Fake auth function

// FileRouter for your app, can contain multiple FileRoutes
export const ourFileRouter = {
  // Define as many FileRoutes as you like, each with a unique routeSlug
  imageUploader: f
    // Set permissions and file types for this FileRoute
    .fileTypes(["image", "video"])
    .maxSize("1GB")
    .middleware(async (req) => {
      // This code runs on your server before upload
      const user = await auth(req);

      // If you throw, the user will not be able to upload
      if (!user) throw new Error("Unauthorized");

      // Whatever is returned here is accessible in onUploadComplete as `metadata`
      return { userId: user.id };
    })
    .onUploadComplete(async ({ metadata, file }) => {
      // This code RUNS ON YOUR SERVER after upload
      console.log("Upload complete for userId:", metadata.userId);

      console.log("file url", file.url);
    }),
} satisfies FileRouter;

export type OurFileRouter = typeof ourFileRouter;
```

### Create an API route using the FileRouter

<Callout type="warning">
  Note: This is the ONLY FILE WHERE THE PATH MATTERS. You need to serve this API
  from `/api/uploadthing` on your application.
</Callout>

```ts copy
/** src/api/uploadthing/index.ts */
import { createServerHandler } from "@uploadthing/solid";
import { ourFileRouter } from "./core";

export const { GET, POST } = createServerHandler({
  router: ourFileRouter,
});
```

### Use the FileRouter in your app

The `@uploadthing/solid` package includes an "Uploader" component that you can simply drop into your app, and start uploading files immediately.

```tsx copy
// You need to import our styles for the button to look right. Best to import in the root /layout.tsx but this is fine
import "@uploadthing/solid/styles.css";
import { type VoidComponent } from "solid-js";
import type { OurFileRouter } from "./api/uploadthing/core";
import { Uploader } from "@uploadthing/solid";

const Home: VoidComponent = () => {
  return (
    <main class="flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center justify-center  gap-16 p-24">
      <Uploader<OurFileRouter>
        endpoint="imageUploader"
        // needed when server side rendering
        url="http://localhost:3000"
        onClientUploadComplete={(res) => {
          alert("Upload Completed", res);
        }}
        onUploadError={(error: Error) => {
          // Do something with the error.
          alert(`ERROR! ${error.message}`);
        }}
      />
    </main>
  );
};

export default Home;
```

        endpoint="imageUploader"

```tsx copy
// You need to import our styles for the button to look right. Best to import in the root /layout.tsx but this is fine
import "@uploadthing/solid/styles.css";
import { type VoidComponent } from "solid-js";

import { UploadDropzone } from "@uploadthing/solid";

const Home: VoidComponent = () => {
  return (
    <main class="flex min-h-screen flex-col items-center justify-center  gap-16 p-24">

        endpoint="imageUploader"
        // needed when server side rendering
